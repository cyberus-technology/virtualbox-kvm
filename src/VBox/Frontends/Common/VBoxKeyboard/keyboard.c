/**
 * Initialise the X11 keyboard driver by building up a table to convert X11
 * keycodes to scan codes using a heuristic based on comparing the current
 * keyboard map to known international keyboard layouts.
 * The basic idea is to examine each key in the current layout to see which
 * characters it produces in its normal and its "shifted" state, and to look
 * for known keyboard layouts which it could belong to.  We then guess the
 * current layout based on the number of matches we find.
 * One difficulty with this approach is so-called Dvorak layouts, which are
 * identical to non-Dvorak layouts, but with the keys in a different order.
 * To deal with this, we compare the different candidate layouts to see in
 * which one the X11 keycodes would be most sequential and hope that they
 * really are arranged more or less sequentially.
 *
 * The actual detection of the current layout is done in the sub-function
 * X11DRV_KEYBOARD_DetectLayout.  Once we have determined the layout, since we
 * know which PC scan code corresponds to each key in the layout, we can use
 * this information to associate the scan code with an X11 keycode, which is
 * what the rest of this function does.
 *
 * @warning not re-entrant
 * @returns 1 if the layout found was optimal, 0 if it was not.  This is
 *          for diagnostic purposes
 * @param   display a pointer to the X11 display

 * Initialise the X11 keyboard driver by finding which X11 keycodes correspond
 * to which PC scan codes.  If the keyboard being used is not a PC keyboard,
 * the X11 keycodes will be mapped to the scan codes which the equivalent keys
 * on a PC keyboard would use.
 *
 * We use two algorithms to try to determine the mapping.  See the comments
 * attached to the two algorithm functions (X11DRV_InitKeyboardByLayout and
 * X11DRV_InitKeyboardByType) for descriptions of the algorithms used.  Both
 * functions tell us on return whether they think that they have correctly
 * determined the mapping.  If both functions claim to have determined the
 * mapping correctly, we prefer the second (ByType).  However, if neither does
 * then we prefer the first (ByLayout), as it produces a fuzzy result which is
 * still likely to be partially correct.
 *
 * @warning not re-entrant
 * @returns 1 if the layout found was optimal, 0 if it was not.  This is
 *          for diagnostic purposes
 * @param   display          a pointer to the X11 display
 * @param   byLayoutOK       diagnostic - set to one if detection by layout
 *                           succeeded, and to 0 otherwise
 * @param   byTypeOK         diagnostic - set to one if detection by type
 *                           succeeded, and to 0 otherwise
 * @param   byXkbOK          diagnostic - set to one if detection using XKB
 *                           succeeded, and to 0 otherwise
 * @param   remapScancode    array of tuples that remap the keycode (first
 *                           part) to a scancode (second part)
 * @note  Xkb takes precedence over byType takes precedence over byLayout,
 *        for anyone who wants to log information about which method is in
 *        use.  byLayout is the fallback, as it is likely to be partly usable
 *        even if it doesn't initialise correctly.
