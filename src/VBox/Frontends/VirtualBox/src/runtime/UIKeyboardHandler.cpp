/*
 * Things worth testing when changing this code:
 * - That automatic keyboard capture works.
 * - That the keyboard is captured when the mouse is.
 * - That the host key releases the keyboard when
 *   the keyboard is captured but the mouse not, and both when both are.
 * - That the host key captures both keyboard and mouse.
 * - That the keyboard is captured when the mouse capture notification is
 *   displayed.
 * - That keyboard capture works on X11 hosts when windows are dragged with
 *   various window managers.
 * - That multiple machine windows do not fight for the focus on X11 hosts
 *   (noticeable through strange modifier key and capitals behaviour).
