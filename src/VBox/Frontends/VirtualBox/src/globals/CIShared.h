/** @class CIShared
 *
 *  This template allows to implement the implicit sharing
 *  semantics for user-defined data structures.
 *
 *  The template argument is a structure (or a class) whose objects
 *  need to be implicitly shared by different pieces of code. A class
 *  generated from this template acts as a wrapper for that structure
 *  and provides a safe access (from the shared usage point of view) to its
 *  members. Note that simple C++ types (such as int) cannot be used as
 *  template arguments.
 *
 *  Implicit sharing means that instances of the generated class point to the
 *  same data object of the managed structure until any one of them tries
 *  to change it. When it happens that instance makes a deep copy of the object
 *  (through its copy constructor) and does the actual change on that copy,
 *  keeping the original data unchanged. This technique is also called
 *  "copy on write". Also, any instance can excplicitly stop sharing the data
 *  it references at any time by calling the detach() method directly, which
 *  makes a copy if the data is referenced by more than one instance.
 *
 *  The read-only access to the managed data can be obtained using the
 *  data() method that returns a pointer to the constant data of the type
 *  used as a template argument. The pointer to the non-constant data
 *  is returned by the mData() method, that automatically detaches the
 *  instance if necessary. This method should be used with care, and only
 *  when it is really necessary to change the data -- if you will use it for
 *  the read-only access the implicit sharing will not work because every
 *  instance will have its data detached.
 *
 *  To be able to be used with the VShared template the structure/class
 *  must have public (or protected) constructors and a destructor. If it
 *  doesn't contain pointers as its members then the two constructors
 *  (the default and the copy constructor) and the destructor automatically
 *  generated by the compiler are enough, there's no need to define them
 *  explicitly. If the destructor is defined explicitly it must be
 *  virtual.
 *
 *  The default constructor implemented by this template (it is actually
 *  a constructor with one bool argument that defaults to false) creates
 *  a null instance (i.e. its isNull() method returns false). All null
 *  instances share the same internal data object (created by the default
 *  constructor of the managed structure) and provide only a read-only access
 *  to its members. This means that the mData() method of such an instance
 *  will always return a null pointer and an attempt to access its members
 *  through that pointer will most likely cause a memory access violation
 *  exception. The template doesn't provide any other constructors (except
 *  the copy constructor) because it doesn't know how to initialize the
 *  object of the managed structure, so the only way to create a non-null
 *  instance is to pass true to the constructor mentioned above.
 *
 *  It's a good practice not to use instantiations of this template directly
 *  but derive them instead. This gives an opportunity to define necessary
 *  constructors with arguments that initialize the managed structure, as
 *  well as to define convenient methods to access structure members (instead
 *  of defining them in the structure itself). For example:
 *
 *  @code
 *
 *  // a data structure
 *  struct ACardData {
 *      string name;
 *      // commented out -- not so convenient:
 *      // void setName( const string &n ) { name = n; }
 *  }
 *
 *  // a wrapper
 *  class ACard : publc CIShared< ACardData > {
 *      ACardData() {}  // the default constructor should be visible
 *      ACardData( const string &name ) :
 *          CIShared< ACardData >( false ) // make non-null
 *      {
 *          mData()->name = name;
 *      }
 *      string name() const { return data()->name; }
 *      void setName( const string &name ) { mData()->name = name; }
 *  }
 *
 *  // ...
 *  ACard c( "John" );
 *  // ...
 *  c.setName( "Ivan" );
 *  // the above is shorter than c.data()->name or c.mData()->setName()
 *
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  If some members of the structure need to be private (and therefore
 *  inaccessible through the pointers returned by data() and vData()) you can
 *  simply declare the wrapper class (the ACard class in the example above)
 *  as a friend of the structure and still use the above approach.
 *
 *  For public members of the original structure it's also possible to use
 *  the overloaded operator->(), which is the equivalent of calling the data()
 *  method, i.e.:
 *
 *  @code
 *  // ...
 *  cout << c->name;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The operator!() is overloaded for convenience and is equivalent to the
 *  isNull() method.
 *
 *  The operator==() makes a comparison of two instances.
 *
 *  @todo put the "original" state definition here...
