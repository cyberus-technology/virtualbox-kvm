/**
 * Wrapper around RTNtPathExpand8dot3Path that allocates a buffer instead of
 * working on the input buffer.
 *
 * @returns IPRT status code, see RTNtPathExpand8dot3Path().
 * @param   pUniStrSrc  The path to fix up. MaximumLength is the max buffer
 *                      length.
 * @param   fPathOnly   Whether to only process the path and leave the filename
 *                      as passed in.
 * @param   pUniStrDst  Output string.  On success, the caller must use
 *                      RTUtf16Free to free what the Buffer member points to.
 *                      This is all zeros and NULL on failure.
