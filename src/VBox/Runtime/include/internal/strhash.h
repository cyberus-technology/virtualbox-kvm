/* sdbm:
   This algorithm was created for sdbm (a public-domain reimplementation of
   ndbm) database library. it was found to do well in scrambling bits,
   causing better distribution of the keys and fewer splits. it also happens
   to be a good general hashing function with good distribution. the actual
   function is hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 65599 + str[i]; what is included below
   is the faster version used in gawk. [there is even a faster, duff-device
   version] the magic constant 65599 was picked out of thin air while
   experimenting with different constants, and turns out to be a prime.
   this is one of the algorithms used in berkeley db (see sleepycat) and
   elsewhere. */
