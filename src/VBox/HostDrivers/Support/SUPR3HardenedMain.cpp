/** @page pg_hardening      %VirtualBox %VM Process Hardening
 *
 * The %VM process hardening is to prevent malicious software from using
 * %VirtualBox as a vehicle to obtain kernel level access.
 *
 * The %VirtualBox %VMM requires supervisor (kernel) level access to the CPU.
 * For both practical and historical reasons, part of the %VMM is realized in
 * ring-3, with a rich interface to the kernel part.  While the device
 * emulations can be executed exclusively in ring-3, we have performance
 * optimizations that loads device emulation code into ring-0 and our special
 * raw-mode execution context (none VT-x/AMD-V mode) for handling frequent
 * operations a lot more efficiently.  These share data between all three
 * context (ring-3, ring-0 and raw-mode).  All this poses a rather broad attack
 * surface, which the hardening protects.
 *
 * The hardening focuses primarily on restricting access to the support driver,
 * VBoxDrv or vboxdrv depending on the OS, as it is ultimately the link and
 * instigator of the communication between ring-3 and the ring-0 and raw-mode
 * contexts.  A secondary focus is to make sure malicious code cannot be loaded
 * and executed in the %VM process.  Exactly how we go about this depends a lot
 * on the host OS.
 *
 * @section sec_hardening_supdrv    The Support Driver Interfaces
 *
 * The support driver has several interfaces thru which it can be accessed:
 *      - /dev/vboxdrv (win: \\Device\\VBoxDrv) for full unrestricted access.
 *        Offers a rich I/O control interface, which needs protecting.
 *      - /dev/vboxdrvu (win: \\Device\\VBoxDrvU) for restricted access, which
 *        VBoxSVC uses to query VT-x and AMD-V capabilities.  This does not
 *        require protecting, though we limit it to the vboxgroup on some
 *        systems.
 *      - \\Device\\VBoxDrvStub on Windows for protecting the second stub
 *        process and its child, the %VM process.  This is an open+close
 *        interface, only available to partially verified stub processes.
 *      - \\Device\\VBoxDrvErrorInfo on Windows for obtaining detailed error
 *        information on a previous attempt to open \\Device\\VBoxDrv or
 *        \\Device\\VBoxDrvStub.  Open, read and close only interface.
 *
 * The rest of VBox accesses the device interface thru the support library,
 * @ref grp_sup "SUPR3" / sup.h.
 *
 * The support driver also exposes a set of functions and data that other VBox
 * ring-0 modules can import from.  This includes much of the IPRT we need in
 * the ring-0 part of the %VMM and device emulations.
 *
 * The ring-0 part of the %VMM and device emulations are loaded via the
 * #SUPR3LoadModule and #SUPR3LoadServiceModule support library function, which
 * both translates to a sequence of I/O controls against /dev/vboxdrv.  On
 * Windows we use the native kernel loader to load the module, while on the
 * other systems ring-3 prepares the bits with help from the IPRT loader code.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_hardening_unix  Hardening on UNIX-like OSes
 *
 * On UNIX-like systems (Solaris, Linux, darwin, freebsd, ...) we put our trust
 * in root and that root knows what he/she/it is doing.
 *
 * We only allow root to get full unrestricted access to the support driver.
 * The device node corresponding to unrestricted access (/dev/vboxdrv) is own by
 * root and has a 0600 access mode (i.e. only accessible to the owner, root). In
 * addition to this file system level restriction, the support driver also
 * checks that the effective user ID (EUID) is root when it is being opened.
 *
 * The %VM processes temporarily assume root privileges using the set-uid-bit on
 * the executable with root as owner.  In fact, all the files and directories we
 * install are owned by root and the wheel (or equivalent gid = 0) group,
 * including extension pack files.
 *
 * The executable with the set-uid-to-root-bit set is a stub binary that has no
 * unnecessary library dependencies (only libc, pthreads, dynamic linker) and
 * simply calls #SUPR3HardenedMain.  It does the following:
 *      1. Validate the VirtualBox installation (#supR3HardenedVerifyAll):
 *          - Check that the executable file of the process is one of the known
 *            VirtualBox executables.
 *          - Check that all mandatory files are present.
 *          - Check that all installed files and directories (both optional and
 *            mandatory ones) are owned by root:wheel and are not writable by
 *            anyone except root.
 *          - Check that all the parent directories, all the way up to the root
 *            if possible, only permits root (or system admin) to change them.
 *            This is that to rule out unintentional rename races.
 *          - On some systems we may also validate the cryptographic signtures
 *            of executable images.
 *
 *      2. Open a file descriptor for the support device driver
 *         (#supR3HardenedMainOpenDevice).
 *
 *      3. Grab ICMP capabilities for NAT ping support, if required by the OS
 *         (#supR3HardenedMainGrabCapabilites).
 *
 *      4. Correctly drop the root privileges
 *         (#supR3HardenedMainDropPrivileges).
 *
 *      5. Load the VBoxRT dynamic link library and hand over the file
 *         descriptor to the support library code in it
 *         (#supR3HardenedMainInitRuntime).
 *
 *      6. Load the dynamic library containing the actual %VM front end code and
 *         run it (tail of #SUPR3HardenedMain).
 *
 * The set-uid-to-root stub executable is paired with a dynamic link library
 * which export one TrustedMain entry point (see #FNSUPTRUSTEDMAIN) that we
 * call. In case of error reporting, the library may also export a TrustedError
 * function (#FNSUPTRUSTEDERROR).
 *
 * That the set-uid-to-root-bit modifies the dynamic linker behavior on all
 * systems, even after we've dropped back to the real user ID, is something we
 * take advantage of.  The dynamic linkers takes special care to prevent users
 * from using clever tricks to inject their own code into set-uid processes and
 * causing privilege escalation issues.  This is the exact help we need.
 *
 * The VirtualBox installation location is hardcoded, which means the any
 * dynamic linker paths embedded or inferred from the executable and dynamic
 * libraries are also hardcoded.  This helps eliminating search path attack
 * vectors at the cost of being inflexible regarding installation location.
 *
 * In addition to what the dynamic linker does for us, the VirtualBox code will
 * not directly be calling either RTLdrLoad or dlopen to load dynamic link
 * libraries into the process.  Instead it will call #SUPR3HardenedLdrLoad,
 * #SUPR3HardenedLdrLoadAppPriv and #SUPR3HardenedLdrLoadPlugIn to do the
 * loading. These functions will perform the same validations on the file being
 * loaded as #SUPR3HardenedMain did in its validation step.  So, anything we
 * load must be installed with root/wheel as owner/group, the directory we load
 * it from must also be owned by root:wheel and now allow for renaming the file.
 * Similar ownership restrictions applies to all the parent directories (except
 * on darwin).
 *
 * So, we place the responsibility of not installing malicious software on the
 * root user on UNIX-like systems.  Which is fair enough, in our opinion.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_hardening_win   Hardening on Windows
 *
 * On Windows we cannot put the same level or trust in the Administrator user(s)
 * (equivalent of root/wheel on unix) as on the UNIX-like systems, which
 * complicates things greatly.
 *
 * Some of the blame for this can be given to Windows being a descendant /
 * replacement for a set of single user systems: DOS, Windows 1.0-3.11 Windows
 * 95-ME, and OS/2.  Users of NT 3.1 and later was inclined to want to always
 * run it with full root/administrator privileges like they had done on the
 * predecessors, while Microsoft didn't provide much incentive for more secure
 * alternatives.  Bad idea, security wise, but execellent for the security
 * software industry.  For this reason using a set-uid-to-root approach is
 * pointless, even if Windows had one.
 *
 * So, in order to protect access to the support driver and protect the %VM
 * process while it's running we have to do a lot more work.  A keystone in the
 * defences is cryptographic code signing.  Here's the short version of what we
 * do:
 *      - Minimal stub executable, signed with the same certificate as the
 *        kernel driver.
 *
 *      - The stub executable respawns itself twice, hooking the NTDLL init
 *        routine to perform protection tasks as early as possible.  The parent
 *        stub helps keep in the child clean for verification as does the
 *        support driver.
 *
 *      - In order to protect against loading unwanted code into the process,
 *        the stub processes installs DLL load hooks with NTDLL as well as
 *        directly intercepting the LdrLoadDll and NtCreateSection APIs.
 *
 *      - The support driver will verify all but the initial process very
 *        thoroughly before allowing them protection and in the final case full
 *        unrestricted access.
 *
 *
 * @subsection  sec_hardening_win_protsoft      3rd Party "Protection" Software
 *
 * What makes our life REALLY difficult on Windows is this 3rd party "security"
 * software which is more or less required to keep a Windows system safe for
 * normal users and all corporate IT departments rightly insists on installing.
 * After the kernel patching clampdown in Vista, anti-* software has to do a
 * lot more mucking about in user mode to get their job (kind of) done.  So, it
 * is common practice to patch a lot of NTDLL, KERNEL32, the executable import
 * table, load extra DLLs into the process, allocate executable memory in the
 * process (classic code injection) and more.
 *
 * The BIG problem with all this is that it is indistinguishable from what
 * malicious software would be doing in order to intercept process activity
 * (network sniffing, maybe password snooping) or gain a level of kernel access
 * via the support driver.  So, the "protection" software is what is currently
 * forcing us to do the pre-NTDLL initialization.
 *
 *
 * @subsection  sec_hardening_win_1st_stub  The Initial Stub Process
 *
 * We share the stub executable approach with the UNIX-like systems, so there's
 * the #SUPR3HardenedMain calling stub executable with its partner DLL exporting
 * TrustedMain and TrustedError.   However, the stub executable does a lot more,
 * while doing it in a more bare metal fashion:
 *      - It does not use the Microsoft CRT, what we need of CRT functions comes
 *        from IPRT.
 *      - It does not statically import anything.  This is to avoid having an
 *        import table that can be patched to intercept our calls or extended to
 *        load additional DLLs.
 *      - Direct NT system calls.  System calls normally going thru NTDLL, but
 *        since there is so much software out there which wants to patch known
 *        NTDLL entry points to control our software (either for good or
 *        malicious reasons), we do it ourselves.
 *
 * The initial stub process is not really to be trusted, though we try our best
 * to limit potential harm (user mode debugger checks, disable thread creation).
 * So, when it enters #SUPR3HardenedMain we only call #supR3HardenedVerifyAll to
 * verify the installation (known executables and DLLs, checking their code
 * signing signatures, keeping them all open to deny deletion and replacing) and
 * does a respawn via #supR3HardenedWinReSpawn.
 *
 *
 * @subsection  sec_hardening_win_2nd_stub  The Second Stub Process
 *
 * The second stub process will be created in suspended state, i.e. the main
 * thread is suspended before it executes a single instruction.  It is also
 * created with a less generous ACLs, though this doesn't protect us from admin
 * users.  In order for #SUPR3HardenedMain to figure that it is the second stub
 * process, the zeroth command line argument has been replaced by a known magic
 * string (UUID).
 *
 * Now, before the process starts executing, the parent (initial stub) will
 * patch the LdrInitializeThunk entry point in NTDLL to call
 * #supR3HardenedEarlyProcessInit via #supR3HardenedEarlyProcessInitThunk.  The
 * parent will also plant some synchronization stuff via #g_ProcParams (NTDLL
 * location, inherited event handles and associated ping-pong equipment).
 *
 * The LdrInitializeThunk entry point of NTDLL is where the kernel sets up
 * process execution to start executing (via a user alert, so it is not subject
 * to SetThreadContext).  LdrInitializeThunk performs process, NTDLL and
 * sub-system client (kernel32) initialization.  A lot of "protection" software
 * uses triggers in this initialization sequence (like the KERNEL32.DLL load
 * event), so we avoid quite a bit of problems by getting our stuff done early
 * on.
 *
 * However, there are also those that uses events that triggers immediately when
 * the process is created or/and starts executing the first instruction.  But we
 * can easily counter these as we have a known process state we can restore. So,
 * the first thing that #supR3HardenedEarlyProcessInit does is to signal the
 * parent to  perform a child purification, so the potentially evil influences
 * can be exorcised.
 *
 * What the parent does during the purification is very similar to what the
 * kernel driver will do later on when verifying the second stub and the %VM
 * processes, except that instead of failing when encountering an shortcoming it
 * will take corrective actions:
 *      - Executable memory regions not belonging to a DLL mapping will be
 *        attempted freed, and we'll only fail if we can't evict them.
 *      - All pages in the executable images in the process (should be just the
 *        stub executable and NTDLL) will be compared to the pristine fixed-up
 *        copy prepared by the IPRT PE loader code, restoring any bytes which
 *        appears differently in the child.  (#g_ProcParams is exempted,
 *        LdrInitializeThunk is set to call NtTerminateThread.)
 *      - Unwanted DLLs will be unloaded (we have a set of DLLs we like).
 *
 * Before signalling the second stub process that it has been purified and should
 * get on with it, the parent will close all handles with unrestricted access to
 * the process and thread so that the initial stub process no longer can
 * influence the child in any really harmful way.  (The caller of CreateProcess
 * usually receives handles with unrestricted access to the child process and
 * its main thread.  These could in theory be used with DuplicateHandle or
 * WriteProcessMemory to get at the %VM process if we're not careful.)
 *
 * #supR3HardenedEarlyProcessInit will continue with opening the log file
 * (requires command line parsing).  It will continue to initialize a bunch of
 * global variables, system calls and trustworthy/harmless NTDLL imports.
 * #supR3HardenedWinInit is then called to setup image verification, that is:
 *      - Hook the NtCreateSection entry point in NTDLL so we can check all
 *        executable mappings before they're created and can be mapped.  The
 *        NtCreateSection code jumps to #supR3HardenedMonitor_NtCreateSection.
 *      - Hook (ditto) the LdrLoadDll entry point in NTDLL so we can
 *        pre-validate all images that gets loaded the normal way (partly
 *        because the NtCreateSection context is restrictive because the NTDLL
 *        loader lock is usually held, which prevents us from safely calling
 *        WinVerityTrust).  The LdrLoadDll code jumps to
 *        #supR3HardenedMonitor_LdrLoadDll.
 *
 * The image/DLL verification hooks are at this point able to verify DLLs
 * containing embedded code signing signatures, and will restrict the locations
 * from which DLLs will be loaded.  When #SUPR3HardenedMain gets going later on,
 * they will start insisting on everything having valid signatures, either
 * embedded or in a signed installer catalog file.
 *
 * The function also irrevocably disables debug notifications related to the
 * current thread, just to make attaching a debugging that much more difficult
 * and less useful.
 *
 * Now, the second stub process will open the so called stub device
 * (\\Device\\VBoxDrvStub), that is a special support driver device node that
 * tells the support driver to:
 *      - Protect the process against the OpenProcess and OpenThread attack
 *        vectors by stripping risky access rights.
 *      - Check that the process isn't being debugged.
 *      - Check that the process contains exactly one thread.
 *      - Check that the process doesn't have any unknown DLLs loaded into it.
 *      - Check that the process doesn't have any executable memory (other than
 *        DLL sections) in it.
 *      - Check that the process executable is a known VBox executable which may
 *        access the support driver.
 *      - Check that the process executable is signed with the same code signing
 *        certificate as the driver and that the on disk image is valid
 *        according to its embedded signature.
 *      - Check all the signature of all DLLs in the process (NTDLL) if they are
 *        signed, and only accept unsigned ones in versions where they are known
 *        not to be signed.
 *      - Check that the code and readonly parts of the executable and DLLs
 *        mapped into the process matches the on disk content (no patches other
 *        than our own two in NTDLL are allowed).
 *
 * Once granted access to the stub device, #supR3HardenedEarlyProcessInit will
 * restore the LdrInitializeThunk code and let the process perform normal
 * initialization.  Leading us to #SUPR3HardenedMain where we detect that this
 * is the 2nd stub process and does another respawn.
 *
 *
 * @subsection  sec_hardening_win_3rd_stub  The Final Stub / VM Process
 *
 * The third stub process is what becomes the %VM process.  Because the parent
 * has opened \\Device\\VBoxDrvSub, it is protected from malicious OpenProcess &
 * OpenThread calls from the moment of inception, practically speaking.
 *
 * It goes thru the same suspended creation, patching, purification and such as
 * its parent (the second stub process).  However, instead of opening
 * \\Device\\VBoxDrvStub from #supR3HardenedEarlyProcessInit, it opens the
 * support driver for full unrestricted access, i.e. \\Device\\VBoxDrv.
 *
 * The support driver will perform the same checks as it did when
 * \\Device\\VBoxDrvStub was opened, but in addition it will:
 *      - Check that the process is the first child of a process that opened
 *        \\Device\\VBoxDrvStub.
 *      - Check that the parent process is still alive.
 *      - Scan all open handles in the system for potentially harmful ones to
 *        the process or the primary thread.
 *
 * Knowing that the process is genuinly signed with the same certificate as the
 * kernel driver, and the exectuable code in the process is either shipped by us
 * or Microsoft, the support driver will trust it with full access and to keep
 * the handle secure.
 *
 * We also trust the protection the support driver gives the process to keep out
 * malicious ring-3 code, and therefore any code, patching or other mysterious
 * stuff that enteres the process must be from kernel mode and that we can trust
 * it (the alternative interpretation is that the kernel has been breanched
 * already, which isn't our responsibility).  This means that, the anti-software
 * products can do whatever they like from this point on.  However, should they
 * do unrevertable changes to the process before this point, VirtualBox won't
 * work.
 *
 * As in the second stub process, we'll now do normal process initialization and
 * #SUPR3HardenedMain will take control.  It will detect that it is being called
 * by the 3rd stub process because of a different magic string starting the
 * command line, and not respawn itself any more.  #SUPR3HardenedMain will
 * recheck the VirtualBox installation, keeping all known files open just like
 * in two previous stub processes.
 *
 * It will then load the Windows cryptographic API and load the trusted root
 * certificates from the Windows store.  The API enables using installation
 * catalog files for signature checking as well as providing a second
 * verification in addition to our own implementation (IPRT).  The certificates
 * allows our signature validation implementation to validate all embedded
 * signatures, not just the microsoft ones and the one signed by our own
 * certificate.
