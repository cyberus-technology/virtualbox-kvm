# If the interface being used does not have IPv6 plumbed and you want
# vboxflt to automatically attach to it by checking for Ipv6 stream every
# "ipv6-pollinterval" seconds.
#
# By default this is disabled meaning if the interface does not have Ipv6
# plumbed when the virtual machine starts, guest<->host Ipv6 will not work
# though guest<->remote Ipv6 would work.
#
# Enable if you have a dynamically plumbing/unplumbing Ipv6 interface for
# which you want vboxflt to adjust accordingly, otherwise keep this disabled.
# Enabling this option will have some minor performance penalty.
