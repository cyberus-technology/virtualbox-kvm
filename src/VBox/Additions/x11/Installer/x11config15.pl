# What this script does: X.org 1.5 introduces full hardware autodetection
# and no longer requires the user to provide an X.org configuration file.
# However, if such a file is provided, it will override autodetection of
# the graphics card (not of vboxmouse as far as I can see).  Although this
# would normally be the user's business, at least Fedora 9 still generates
# a configuration file by default, so we have to rewrite it if we want
# the additions to work on a default guest installation.  So we simply go
# through any configuration files we may find on the system and replace
# references to VESA or framebuffer drivers (which might be autodetected
# for use on a VirtualBox guest) and replace them with vboxvideo.
