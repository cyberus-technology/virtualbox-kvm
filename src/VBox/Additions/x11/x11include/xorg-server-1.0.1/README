The contents of this directory were extracted from the contents of the
archive xorg-server-X11R7.0-1.0.1.tar.bz2, as downloaded from ftp.x.org, using
the following shell script:

for i in `find xorg-server-X11R7.0-1.0.1 -name '*.h' | grep -v hw/xwin \
 | grep -v hw/xquartz | grep -v hw/kdrive | grep -v hw/xnest \
 | grep -v hw/xprint | grep -v hw/xgl`
  do
    cp $i $PATH_VBOX/src/VBox/Additions/x11/x11include/xorg-server-1.0.1/
  done

In addition, the file xf86config.h was removed, as it conflicts with
xf86Config.h on non-case-sensitive file-systems.
