/** @page pg_vbglr0_phys_heap   VBoxGuestLibR0 - Physical memory heap.
 *
 * Traditional heap implementation keeping all blocks in a ordered list and
 * keeping free blocks on additional list via pointers in the user area.  This
 * is similar to @ref grp_rt_heap_simple "RTHeapSimple" and
 * @ref grp_rt_heap_offset "RTHeapOffset" in IPRT, except that this code handles
 * mutiple chunks and has a physical address associated with each chunk and
 * block.  The alignment is fixed (VBGL_PH_ALLOC_ALIGN).
 *
 * When allocating memory, a free block is found that satisfies the request,
 * extending the heap with another chunk if needed.  The block is split if it's
 * too large, and the tail end is put on the free list.
 *
 * When freeing memory, the block being freed is put back on the free list and
 * we use the block list to check whether it can be merged with adjacent blocks.
 *
 * @note The original code managed the blocks in two separate lists for free and
 *       allocated blocks, which had the disadvantage only allowing merging with
 *       the block after the block being freed.  On the plus side, it had the
 *       potential for slightly better locality when examining the free list,
 *       since the next pointer and block size members were closer to one
 *       another.
