/** @file v3d_fence.c
 *
 * Seqno-based fence management.
 *
 * We have two mechanisms for waiting in our kernel API: You can wait on a BO
 * to have all rendering to from any process to be completed, or wait on a
 * seqno for that particular seqno to be passed.  The fence API we're
 * implementing is based on waiting for all rendering in the context to have
 * completed (with no reference to what other processes might be doing with
 * the same BOs), so we can just use the seqno of the last rendering we'd
 * fired off as our fence marker.
