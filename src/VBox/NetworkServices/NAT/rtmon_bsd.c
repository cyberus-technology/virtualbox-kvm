/**
 * Query IPv6 routing table - BSD routing sockets version.
 *
 * We don't actually monitor the routing socket for updates, and
 * instead query the kernel each time.
 *
 * We take a shortcut and don't read the reply to our RTM_GET - if
 * there's no default IPv6 route, write(2) will fail with ESRCH
 * synchronously.  In theory it may fail asynchronously and we should
 * wait for the RTM_GET reply and check rt_msghdr::rtm_errno.
 *
 * KAME code in *BSD maintains internally a list of default routers
 * that it learned from RAs, and installs only one of them into the
 * routing table (actually, I'm not sure if BSD routing table can
 * handle multiple routes to the same destination).  One side-effect
 * of this is that when manually configured route (e.g. teredo) is
 * deleted, the system will lose its default route even when KAME IPv6
 * has default router(s) in its internal list.  Next RA will force the
 * update, though.
 *
 * Solaris does expose multiple routes in the routing table and
 * replies to RTM_GET with "default default".
