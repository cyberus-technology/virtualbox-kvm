# Put bits of the pre-uninstallation here which should work the same for all of
# the Linux installers.  We do not use special helpers (e.g. dh_* on Debian),
# but that should not matter, as we know what those helpers actually do, and we
# have to work on those systems anyway when installed using the all
# distributions installer.
#
# We assume that all required files are in the same folder as this script
# (e.g. /opt/VirtualBox, /usr/lib/VirtualBox, the build output directory).
#
# Script exit status: 0 on success, 1 if VirtualBox is running and can not be
# stopped (installers may show an error themselves or just pass on standard
# error).


# The below is GNU-specific.  See VBox.sh for the longer Solaris/OS X version.
