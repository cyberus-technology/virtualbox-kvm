 Notes on BIOS usage
 -------------------

- DOS (including 6.22/7.1) does not need INT 15h or INT 1Ah. Most other
  operating systems require INT 15h to detect installed memory.

- OS/2 (WSeB/MCP/ACP) and Windows 98 SE are some of the very few operating
  systems which use the El Torito floppy emulation.

- NetWare 5.1 is one of the *extremely* few users of El Torito hard disk
  emulation.

- Keystroke check (INT 16h, fn 01h/11h) always enables interrupts on return.
  DOS POWER.EXE depends on that in some situations.

- IBM DOS J5.00/V is even worse and does a far jump into INT 16h/11h after
  pushing garbage on the stack. Using IRET directly may change IOPL, set
  TF, change direction flag, etc. We have to use or simulate RETF 2 instead.

- MS-DOS 5.0/V setup assumes that INT 13h always returns with interrupts
  enabled.

- INT 15h also always returns with interrupts enabled (even for unsupported
  functions).

- MS-DOS 6.2/V is a rare user of the INT 15h keyboard intercept routines.

- Some software uses the model byte at F000:FFFE to determine the system
  type (PC-DOS 3.0, Norton Utilities 8). Other software first tries INT 15h,
  fn C0h instead (PC-DOS 3.1, MSD).

- DOS 4.01 (both IBM and Microsoft) calls INT 13h to read from disk with less
  than 100 bytes of stack space early in the boot sequence. This tends to be
  a problem especially for the SATA and SCSI code paths.

- Very few guests use the 32-bit PCI BIOS interface. One is OS/2 (but falls
  back), another is Etherboot.

- OS/2 is the only known guest which can run the 16-bit PCI BIOS in protected
  mode (but only if the 32-bit PCI BIOS is unavailable).

- NetWare 6.x is the only known guest which uses the PCI BIOS service to read
  the IRQ routing table.

- NetWare 6.5 boot CD is a rare user of INT 15h/86h, asking for 1,000,000
  microsecond (1 second) delays. The initial NW 6.5 release boots to Caldera
  DOS and does not exhibit this behavior. NetWare 6.5 SP2 and later boots
  straight to NetWare and uses the 1-second sleep.

- Any disk reads which use bus-master DMA (AHCI, IDE BM) must use VDS
  (Virtual DMA Services) when present. Otherwise any reads/writes when the
  real mode addresses don't map directly to physical addresses will fail
  horribly. DOS 6.x with EMM386 is a good testcase (esp. loading drivers
  into UMBs).

- Many older OSes (especially UNIX based) require the FDPT to contain
  physical ATA disk geometry; for that reason, disks smaller than ~500MB are
  easiest to use. Otherwise a "large" BIOS disk option would be required.

- Older NetWare IDE disk drivers (IDE.DSK from 1993, likely older as well)
  fall into the same category. If FDPT contains logical geometry, NetWare
  malfunctions. NetWare 3.x/4.x is unusual in that it boots from a DOS
  partition using BIOS, and only later switches to its own disk drivers.
  NetWare reportedly understands FDPT cylinder values over 1024, but requires
  physical disk geometry in the FDPT (only up to 16 heads).

- Some really old OSes (Xenix circa 1986-7) do not understand the EBDA idea
  and clear the memory. For those, the FDPT must be in the BIOS ROM area, or
  the OS will destroy it (even when it's at 0:300 in the IVT).

- NetWare 2.15 has a similar restriction, the FDPT must explicitly point above
  segment address C800 or the NetWare AT disk driver abends.

- Windows NT (including XP) uses INT 13h/08h to obtain the DPT for each floppy
  drive. NT assumes a 13-byte DPT which includes the number of tracks. NT will
  refuse to read more tracks than the DPT specifies and formats as many tracks
  as the DPT specifies.

- Windows 98 SE boot CD uses 32-bit registers in real mode and will fail in
  mysterious ways if BIOS trashes high bits of EAX (and likely others).

- PC DOS 6.x/7.x QCONFIG is a rare user of INT 16h fn 0Ah (read keyboard ID).

- DOS POWER.EXE uses the real mode APM interface, Windows 3.1 POWER.DRV and
  OS/2 APM.SYS use the 16-bit protected mode APM interface, and Windows 9x
  uses the 32-bit protected mode APM interface.

- Windows 98 is one of the few APM 1.2 users; Windows 95 uses APM 1.1, while
  newer systems prefer ACPI.

- Windows 3.1 Standard mode violates the APM specifications and calls into
  APM with CPL=3, causing the HLT instruction to fault if used. 386 Enhanced
  mode Windows 3.1 calls into APM with CPL=3.

- QNX4 calls 16-bit protected-mode PCI BIOS in an environment where ESP is
  16-bit but SS is a 32-bit stack segment. In such environments, using the
  ENTER/LEAVE sequence is fatal if the high word of EBP is non-zero (which
  it will be with QNX 4.25). LEAVE propagates the high word of EBP into ESP
  with fatal consequences.

- Plan 9 also runs 16-bit code with a 32-bit stack segment, except Plan 9
  thinks it counts as real mode. Same ENTER/LEAVE problem as above.

- AIX 1.3 is a rare user of INT 15h/89h (switch to protected mode) service.

- IBM OS/2 1.0/1.1 (but not other versions!) attempt to execute a 286 LOADALL
  instruction. LOADALL must be emulated for OS/2 to work properly. HIMEM.SYS
  version 2.03 and later also contains 286 LOADALL code but this will not be
  executed on 386+ processors.

- IBM and Microsoft OS/2 1.0 use CMOS shutdown status 9 to get back from
  protected mode without having called INT 15h/87h at all. That makes the
  status 9 handling a public interface (just like codes 5 and 0Ah) which
  has to be compatible with other BIOS implementations.

- Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 with MPS HAL requires that INT 15h/E820h return the
  I/O APIC range as reserved, or not return any ranges at all just below 4GB.
  Otherwise the NT kernel will crash early during init due to confusion about
  the top of memory.

- Darwin x86 6.0.2 ISO (darwinx86-602.iso) has a bizarre boot sector (using
  El Torito hard disk emulation) with the first five bytes being zero. It
  appears to be valid despite the oddity.

- Darwin 6.0.2 also uses an El Torito emulated hard disk. In addition, if
  INT 13h/41h succeeds, Darwin uses INT13X to read from the emulated drive.

- Symantec Ghost 11.5 bootable CD also uses El Torito hard disk emulation,
  uses INT13X without checking for support, and crashes if INT13X is not
  supported on the emulated drive.


 286 BIOS
 --------

 For testing purposes, it's quite useful to have a BIOS that can run in a
classic PC/AT environment with a 286 CPU. This forces various changes, not
always obvious:

 - C code can be easily compiled to produce 286-compatible object code

 - 32-bit BIOS services such as APM or PCI BIOS are irrelevant

 - PCI cannot be supported because it requires 32-bit port I/O

 - AHCI cannot be supported because it requires 32-bit port I/O and PCI

 - Switching to protected mode must be done using LMSW instead of CR0

 - Switching back to real mode must reset the CPU (currently triple fault)
   and regain control by setting up the CMOS shutdown status byte


 
 Notes on BIOS implementation
 ----------------------------

- To return values from functions not declared as __interrupt, the arguments
  may need to be declared volatile (not ideal, but does the job).

- The way the POST code selectively clears or doesn't clear memory
  is extremely suspect and will need reworking.

- Need to review string routines wrt direction flag (should be OK now).

- Need to review CMOS access wrt interrupts (possible index reg change by
  an interrupt handler).

- The POST code zeroes the entire BDA, and then various bits zero specific
  parts of the BDA again. That's a waste of time.

- After a reset, all interrupts are unmasked. Not sure if that's OK.

- BCC mishandles the following (where buf is an uint8_t array):
  lba=buf[0x2B]*0x1000000+buf[0x2A]*0x10000+buf[0x29]*0x100+buf[0x28];
  The buf[x]*100 expression should end up being of type signed int, which
  causes the sign to be incorrectly propagated. BCC incorrectly keeps
  the type unsigned.

- The PCI BIOS services are implemented in C, compiled twice as 16-bit and
  32-bit code. This reduces the development effort and significantly lowers
  the risk of discrepancies between 16-bit and 32-bit implementation. Care
  must be taken because the 16-bit implementation can be executed in both
  real and protected mode.

- APM can be in theory implemented only once for real, 16-bit protected and
  32-bit protected mode. Unfortunately this is very inconvenient in C since
  the default stack size changes between 16-bit and 32-bit callers. Therefore
  real mode APM (which supports most functions) is implemented in C and
  protected-mode APM is written in assembler for both 16-bit and 32-bit calls,
  with a small 32->16 thunk.

- The -of switch can be used to avoid generating ENTER/LEAVE instructions.
  This appears to be an undocumented and perhaps unintentional side effect.


 Code size notes (code as of 7/6/2011):

 The following values are the size of the _TEXT segment, i.e. only C code;
data defined in C is not included, neither are assembly modules.

 Options:                Size (hex):
 --------                -----------
 -0 -zu -s -oas -ecc     631A
 -3 -zu -s -oas -ecc     5C1E
 -0 -zu -s -oas          578A
 -3 -zu -s -oas          5452
 
 Both generating 386 code and using register-based calling convention for
internal functions brings significant size savings (15% when combined).
