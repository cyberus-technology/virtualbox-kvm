/** @page pg_dev_3c501  3Com 3C501 Ethernet Controller Emulation.
 *
 * This software was written based on the following documents:
 *
 *     - 3Com IBM Ethernet (IE) Controller/Transceiver
 *          External Reference Specification, March 15, 1983
 *     - 3Com EtherLink (3C501) Adapter Technical Reference
 *          Manual Part No. 6405-00, November 26, 1988
 *     - SEEQ 8001 EDLC Ethernet Data Link Controller
 *          Preliminary Data Sheet, December 1982
 *
 * The emulation is compatible with 3Com 3C501 EtherLink aka IE4. It also
 * appears to be compatible with the original 1982 3C500 IBM Ethernet aka
 * IE; the IE and IE4 documentation is nearly identical.
 *
 * The EtherLink is a very early design. It has only a single 2K buffer for
 * both send and receive, and was desgined long before full-duplex Ethernet
 * was possible (it is capable of simultaneous send and receive, but only in
 * loopback mode). If it has just received a packet, the EtherLink can't
 * receive another packet until the first one has been processed by the
 * host.
 *
 * The above problem is greatly alleviated in a VM because incoming packets
 * can be buffered for a short while and don't have to be immediately
 * dropped just because the adapter is currently sending or because the
 * receive status register has not been read yet.
 *
 * The first 8 registers (station address, receive and transmit command and
 * status) are implemented in the SEEQ 8001 EDLC chip. The remaining 8
 * registers are provided by the 3Com ASIC (0755-02) on the 3C501 or
 * discrete chips on the 3C500.
 *
 * The '16 collisions' bit in the transmit command/status register is nearly
 * useless. The SEEQ 8001 could retransmit automatically, but the IE/IE4 can
 * not because the GP Buffer Pointer needs to be reinitialized by software
 * prior to each transmit attempt. It is unclear if the 16-collision counter
 * only rolls over modulo 16 or if it is cleared by something other than
 * reset.
 *
 * The 3C501 supports DMA transfers to/from the packet buffer. Many drivers
 * don't use DMA by default or at all. Due to the overhead of programming
 * the DMA controller, direct I/O access (rep insb/outsb) is always faster
 * in a VM. DMA would only be a win for very ancient drivers which don't use
 * the rep insb/outsb instructions (those didn't exist on the 8086/8088).
 *
 * NB: The default DMA channel (channel 1) conflicts with the default Sound
 * Blaster settings. If both 3C501 and SB16 are used, then one of them
 * either needs to be reconfigured to use DMA channel other than 1 or the
 * 3C501 must not use DMA.
 *
 * The 3Com documentation implies that writing the low byte of the Receive
 * Buffer Pointer is enough to clear the pointer. Yet almost all drivers,
 * including 3Com's sample code, write zeros to both the low and high bytes
 * of the Receive Buffer Pointer when clearing it. BSD drivers (if_el.c)
 * notably only write the low byte. It has been verified on a real 3C501
 * that the documentation is correct. Writing anything to the Receive Buffer
 * Pointer LSB clears the pointer (writing to the MSB appears to have no
 * effect whatsoever).
 *
 * If the Receive Buffer Pointer is not explicitly cleared prior to
 * receiving a packet, it will simply keep incrementing from wherever it
 * was. Once it hits the end of the buffer (wraps around to zero), a
 * receive overflow will be triggered (because the EDLC's FIFO will no
 * longer be serviced) but the buffer will contain however much data there
 * was room for. Note that the SEEQ 8001 datasheet is not explicit, but the
 * EDLC can probably receive frames with more than 1,500 octets of payload.
 *
 * The GP Buffer Pointer behavior is quite curious. It appears to be
 * internally a 12-bit pointer, and its top bit (that is, bit 11) is ignored
 * when addressing into the 2K buffer. When writing the MSB, the top 5 bits
 * are masked (always written as zero), i.e. only a 11-bit value can be
 * written. Through auto-increment, the GP Buffer Pointer can reach values
 * that can be read but not written.
 *
 * The implementation was tested for correctness using 3Com's diagnostic
 * utility (3C501.EXE, Version 2.4, 1986 and also DIAGNOSE.COM, Version 2.0,
 * 1983) and "passes diagnose with flying colors". Note that the interrupt
 * test does not pass in V2.3 diagnostics by default because it writes an
 * EOI to port 0F820h instead of 20h, relying on the system board to decode
 * only the low 10 bits of the address. PCI-based systems decode all address
 * bits and writes to address 0F820h do not reach the interrupt controller.
 * The 3C501.EXE utility can be run with the '-i' switch to skip interrupt
 * tests; the older DIAGNOSE.COM does not have that problem. In both
 * versions, the preliminary test fails if the MAC address OID is not
 * 02:60:8C (the utility thinks the PROM is corrupted).
 *
 * 3Com's XNS driver (ETH.SYS) likewise requires the OID to be 02:60:8C,
 * otherwise the driver uses 00:00:00:00:00:00 as its MAC address, which is
 * not something that produces useful results. Most old drivers (NetWare,
 * NDIS, XENIX) don't care about the OID, but some (BSDs, Linux, some SCO
 * UNIX versions) want to see the 3Com OID.
 *
 * The MS Networks Client setup also requires the OID to match 3Com's when
 * detecting the hardware, but the actual NDIS driver does not care. Note
 * that the setup fails to detect the emulated 3C501 at the default 0x300
 * base address, but finds it at 0x310 and other addresses.
 *
 * Note that especially newer Linux/BSD OSes are a lost cause. Their 3C501
 * drivers are very hard to configure, broken in various ways, and likely
 * untested. For example the Linux driver clears the receive buffer pointer
 * at the end of the interrupt handler, which may easily happen after a
 * packet was already received. In FreeBSD 6.4, the kernel crashes when the
 * el0 driver is loaded. In FreeBSD 5.0, the el0 driver sends packets and
 * reads packets from the card, but the OS never sees any incoming data
 * (even though the receive packet counter keeps going up).
 *
 * The precise receive logic (when a packet is copied to the buffer, when an
 * interrupt is signaled, when receive goes idle) is difficult to understand
 * from the 3Com documentation, but is extensively tested by the diagnostic
 * utility. The SEEQ 8001 datasheet may be easier to understand than the
 * EtherLink documentation.
 *
 * Some drivers (e.g. NetWare DOS IPX shell and ODI drivers) like to reset
 * the chip more or less after every packet is sent or received. That leads
 * to a situation where the NIC is briefly unable to receive anything. If we
 * drop packets in that case, we end up with well over 10% packet loss and
 * terrible performance. We have to hold off and not drop packets just
 * because the receiver is disabled for a moment.
 *
 * Note that the reset bit in the auxiliary command register does not nearly
 * reset the entire chip as the documentation suggests. It may only truly
 * reset the SEEQ 8001 EDLC chip. It is impossible to say how going out of
 * reset affects the auxiliary command register itself, since it must be
 * written to exit the reset state. The reset bit clears the EDLC transmit
 * and command registers, but not the programmed station address. It also
 * does not disturb the packet buffer, and it does not clear the GP Buffer
 * Pointer.
 *
 * The default EtherLink configuration uses I/O base 300h, IRQ 3, DMA
 * channel 1. Prior to May 1983, the default IRQ was 5. On old EtherLink
 * cards, the I/O address was configurable from 200h-3F0h in increments of
 * 16, DMA 1 or 3, and IRQ 3 or 5. Newer EtherLinks (starting circa in 1984)
 * in addition allow DMA 2 and IRQ 2, 4, 6, and 7.
