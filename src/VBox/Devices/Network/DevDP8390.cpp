 *
 *
 * The National Semiconductor DP8390 was an early (circa 1986) low-cost
 * Ethernet controller, typically accompanied by the DP8391 Serial Network
 * Interface and the DP8392 Coaxial Transceiver Interface.
 *
 * Due to its relatively low cost, the DP8390 NIC was chosen for several
 * very widespread early PC Ethernet designs, namely the Novell NE1000/NE2000,
 * Western Digital (later SMC) WD8003 EtherCard Plus, and 3Com EtherLink II.
 * The popularity of these cards, especially the NE2000, in turn spawned
 * a bevy of compatible chips from National Semiconductor and many others.
 *
 * All common DP8390-based cards have onboard memory. The initial WD8003E and
 * NE1000 cards have one 8Kx8 SRAM; 16-bit cards like WD8013E or NE2000 have
 * two 8Kx8 SRAMs wired in 8Kx16 configuration to enable 16-bit wide transfers.
 * The DP8390 can address up to 64K or local memory and uses "Local DMA"
 * (similar to bus mastering) to access it. Some newer cards had 32K or more
 * onboard RAM. Note that an NE2000 in 8-bit mode can only address 8K local
 * memory, effectively reverting to an NE1000.
 *
 * The DP8390 uses "Remote DMA" to move data between local memory and the host
 * system. Remote DMA is quite similar to 8237-style third party DMA, except
 * the DMA controller is on the DP8390 chip in this case.
 *
 * The DP8390 has a control bit (DCR.WTS) which selects whether all DMA (both
 * Local and Remote) transfers are 8-bit or 16-bit. Word-wide transfers can
 * generally only be used on a 16-bit card in a 16-bit slot, because only then
 * can the host drive 16-bit I/O cycles to the data ports. That is why
 * an NE2000 in an 8-bit slot can only use half of its local RAM -- remote DMA
 * simply cannot access half of the 8Kx16 SRAM.
 *
 * The DP8390 maps its internal registers as sixteen 8-bit wide I/O ports.
 * There are four register pages, selectable through the Command Register (CR)
 * which is accessible at offset 0 in all pages.
 *
 * The NE1000/NE2000 cards only use I/O and IRQ resources, not memory
 * or DMA. In contrast, the Western Digital cards use memory-mapped buffers.
 * Later AT/LANTIC (DP83905) based NE2000-compatible cards can optionally
 * use memory as well. The 3Com EtherLink II (3C503) uses a custom gate array
 * in addition to the DP8390 and can use programmed I/O, 8237 DMA, as well
 * as optional direct memory mapping.
 *
 * Address decoding is typically incomplete, which causes the buffer RAM and
 * possibly PROM to be aliased multiple times in the DP8390's address space.
 *
 * Buffer overflow handling is slightly tricky. The DP8390 assumes that if
 * the receiver is enabled, there is space for at least one page (256 bytes).
 * Once it fills up the page and advances the CURR pointer, the DP8390 checks
 * whether CURR equals BNRY and if so, triggers an overflow condition. Note
 * that after the NIC is initialized, CURR *will* normally equal BNRY, with
 * both pointing at the beginning of the receive ring (PSTART). An overflow
 * is only triggered when CURR equals BNRY right after advancing.
 *
 * The documentation of the Send Packet command mentions that when CRDA crosses
 * the PSTOP register, the current remote DMA address (i.e. CRDA) is set to
 * the PSTART value, which is rather convenient when reading received packets
 * out of the ring buffer using remote DMA. The documentation does not mention
 * that the same logic applies for all remote DMA reads, a feature that several
 * NE1000/NE2000 drivers (packet drivers, Novell ODI) rely on. This is logical,
 * because reading out of the receive ring buffer address range always implies
 * reading received packets, and then the PSTOP->PSTART wraparound becomes
 * desirable. It is unclear whether the same wraparound handling also applies
 * for remote DMA writes within the receive ring buffer.
 *
 * The documentation is not very clear on how the CRDA register is managed.
 * One might be led to believe that starting remote DMA copies the remote DMA
 * start address (i.e. RSAR) to the CRDA register. However, the NE1000 ODI
 * driver for OS/2 1.0 (NE1000.SYS from early 1988) relies on restarting remote
 * DMA and continuing where it left off. The DP8390D datasheet only mentions
 * this in a passing fashion at the end of the "Remote Write with High Speed
 * Buses" section, saying that if a dummy remote read is executed before a
 * remote write, RSAR can be set up for the dummy read such that the CRDA
 * register contains the desired value for the following write.
 *
 * Conversely, it is not spelled out that writing RSAR also updates CRDA, but
 * at least Novell's NE2000 ODI driver v2.12 is known to rely on this behavior
 * and checks that a write to RSAR is reflected in CRDA.
 *
 * Loopback operation is limited in the DP8390. Because it is a half-duplex
 * device, it cannot truly transmit and receive simultaneously. When loopback
 * is in effect, the received data is *not* written into memory. Only the last
 * few bytes of the packet are visible in the FIFO.
 *
 * Likewise due to its half-duplex nature, the CRC circuitry during loopback
 * works either only on the transmit side (FCS is generated but not checked)
 * or the receive side (FCS is checked but not generated).
 *
 * The loopback behavior is even stranger when DCR.WTS is set to enabled 16-bit
 * DMA transfers. Even though the chip reads 16 bits at a time, only 8 bits are
 * actually transmitted; the DCR.BOS bit determines whether the low or high
 * 8 bits of each words are transmitted. As a consequence, the programmed length
 * of the transmit is also halved.
 *
 * Because loopback operation is so different from normal send/receive, loopback
 * packets are not run through the normal receive path and are treated specially
 * instead. The WD and especially 3C503 diagnostics exercise the loopback
 * functionality fairly thoroughly.
 *
 *
 * NE1000 and NE2000
 * -----------------
 *
 * Common NE1000/NE2000 configurations in Novell drivers:
 *   I/O Base = 300h, IRQ = 3 (default)
 *   I/O Base = 320h, IRQ = 2
 *   I/O Base = 340h, IRQ = 4
 *   I/O Base = 360h, IRQ = 5
 * The I/O base can be set to 300h/320h/340h/360h; the IRQ to 2, 3, 4, 5.
 * No memory or DMA is used.
 *
 * The NE1000/NE2000 adds a data register and a reset register to the I/O
 * space. A PROM containing the node address is mapped into the DP8390's local
 * address space.
 *
 * The mapping of the 32x8 PROM on an NE2000 card is quite non-obvious but
 * fortunately well explained in the AN-729 Application Note. Address lines
 * A4-A1 of the internal bus are connected to lines A3-A0 of the PROM
 * (enabling 16 distinct bytes of the 32-byte PROM to be addressed). However,
 * the negated EN16 signal, which is active when the NE2000 is in a 16-bit
 * slot, is connected to the PROM's address line A4. That means an NE2000 in
 * a 16-bit slot reads different PROM bytes than when the same card is in an
 * 8-bit slot. The PROM is structured such that an NE2000 in an 8-bit slot
 * reads a 'BB' signature (same as NE1000) at PROM offset 1Eh/1Fh, while
 * an NE2000 in a 16-bit slot returns a 'WW' signature from PROM offset
 * 0Eh/0Fh instead.
 *
 * The original NE1000 boards Assy. #950-054401 actually only had 6 bytes of
 * MAC address in the PROM, the rest was unused (0FFh). Software supporting the
 * NE1000 thus should not examine the PROM contents beyond the first 6 bytes.
 *
 * Novell's old OUI was 00:00:D8 but drivers are not known to check for it.
 *
 * Newer DP83905 AT/LANTIC based NE2000plus cards were optionally capable of
 * using shared RAM in a manner very similar to the WD8003/WD8013.
 *
 *
 * WD8003 and WD8013 EtherCard Plus
 * --------------------------------
 *
 * Common WD8013 configurations:
 *   I/O Base = 280h, IRQ = 3,  RAM D000-D3FF (default)
 *   I/O Base = 330h, IRQ = 10, RAM CC00-CFFF
 *   I/O Base = 240h, IRQ/RAM soft-configurable
 * The I/O base can be set anywhere in the 2xxh-3xxh range in 20h increments.
 * The IRQs available on a WD8013 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15. The shared
 * RAM can be anywhere between 80000h (512K) to FFC000h (16M-16K) in 16K
 * increments.
 *
 * The Western Digital WD8003E appeared at around the same time as Novell's
 * NE1000 (1987). It is likewise a short 8-bit ISA card with 8Kx8 onboard
 * SRAM. The major difference is that rather than using remote DMA to move
 * data between the host and local RAM, the WD8003 directly mapps the onboard
 * memory to the host's address space (often called shared memory). A later
 * 16-bit WD8013 model used 8Kx16 SRAM, and there were follow-on WD8003 models
 * with 16K or 32K local RAM.
 *
 * Instead of mapping the PROM into the DP8390's local address space, the
 * WD8003/WD8013 exposes the node address through the I/O space; the DP8390's
 * local address space only contains buffer RAM.
 *
 * The WD8003 cannot use remote DMA at all; the host must use shared memory.
 * Remote DMA can be programmed but there is no way to trigger RDMA transfers.
 *
 * Western Digital's brand name for WD8003/WD8013 was EtherCard. Circa 1991,
 * WD sold the networking business to SMC; SMC continued to sell and further
 * develop the cards under the Elite brand name, also designated as the
 * SMC8000 series.
 *
 * The original WD8003E/EBT/WT uses very simple glue logic around the DP8390
 * and must be configured through jumpers. Newer WD8003EB/EP/EW/W/WC uses an
 * interface chip (WD83C583, WD83C584, or later) with an EEPROM and can be
 * configured through a software utility.
 *
 * Similarly the 16-bit WD8013EBT is configured only though jumpers, while
 * the newer WD8013EB/W/EW/EWC/WC/EPC are software configurable.
 *
 * The "Board ID" byte (at offset 6 in the PROM) is used to distinguish
 * between the various models.
 *
 * Newer WD cards use the WD83C690 controller rather than DP8390. The
 * WD83C690 is close enough to DP8390 that old WD drivers should work with
 * it, but it has a number of differences. It has no support for Remote DMA
 * whatsoever, and does not implement multicast filtering.
 *
 * The WD83C690 also handles receive buffer overflows somewhat differently;
 * the DP8390 never fills the last remaining buffer page, meaning that
 * CURR=BNRY indicates an empty buffer while CURR=BNRY-1 means buffer full.
 * The WD83C690 can fill all pages and decides whether it is full or empty
 * based on whether CURR or BNRY was changed more recently.
 *
 * Old Western Digital utilities/drivers may require the card to have WD's
 * old OUI of 00:00:0C and refuse to recognize the hardware otherwise.
 *
 * The emulation passes WD diagnostics with no errors (DIAGNOSE.EXE Ver 1.11,
 * dated 12/12/1989).
 *
 *
 * 3C503 EtherLink II
 * ------------------
 *
 * Common 3C503 configurations in Novell drivers:
 *   I/O Base = 300h, IRQ = 3 (default)
 * The I/O base can be set via jumpers to 2E0h, 2A0h, 280h, 250h, 350h, 330h,
 * 310h, or 300h (default). The ROM/RAM can be optionally mapped to one of
 * DC000-DFFFF, D8000-DBFFF, CC000-CFFFF, or C8000-CBFFF, again configured
 * through jumpers. The available IRQs are 2, 3, 4, or 5, and DRQs 1, 2, or 3,
 * both soft-configurable (no IRQ/DRQ jumpers).
 *
 * Yet another design based on the DP8390 was the 3Com 3C503 EtherLink II,
 * available sometime in 1988. Unlike Novell and WD, 3Com added a custom
 * host interface ASIC ("Gate Array") which handles all transfers to and from
 * the 8Kx8 onboard SRAM. The 3C503 can map the card's local RAM directly
 * into the host's address space, alternatively software can use either PIO
 * or 8-bit DMA to transfer data.
 *
 * For reasons that are not entirely clear, 3Com decided that the Remote DMA
 * implementation on the DP3890 (successfully used by the NE1000/NE2000) was
 * too buggy and the Gate Array essentially duplicates the Remote DMA
 * functionality, while also adding 8327 style DMA support (like the DP839EB
 * had) and optional shared RAM.
 *
 * Just like the NE1000/NE2000 and WD8003/WD8013, the 3C503 exists in an
 * 8-bit variant (EtherLink II) and a 16-bit variant (EtherLink II/16),
 * although both types are called 3C503.
 *
 * Since the 3C503 does not require shared RAM to operate, 3Com decided to
 * use a single memory mapping for both a boot ROM (if present) and shared
 * RAM. It is possible to boot from the ROM utilizing PIO or DMA for data
 * transfers, and later switch to shared RAM. However, 3Com needed to add
 * a hack for warm boot; the Vector Pointer Registers (VPTR0/1/2) contain
 * a 20-bit address and the Gate Array monitors the ISA bus for a read cycle
 * to that address. When a read cycle from the VPTR address occurs, the
 * memory mapping is switched from RAM to ROM. The VPTR registers are meant
 * to be programmed with the warm boot vector (often F000:FFF0 or FFFF0h).
 *
 * Some UNIX 3C503 drivers may require the card to have 3Com's old OUI
 * of 02:60:8C and refuse to detect the hardware otherwise. Likewise the
 * 3C503 diagnostics fail if the OUI is not 3Com's.
 *
 * The emulation passes 3Com diagnostics with flying colors (3C503.EXE Version
 * 1.5, dated 11/26/1991).
 *
 *
 * Linux Drivers
 *
 * The DP8390 driver (shared by NE1000/NE2000, WD8003/WD8013, and 3C503 drivers)
 * in Linux has severe bugs in the receive path. The driver clears receive
 * interrupts *after* going through the receive ring; that causes it to race
 * against the DP8390 chip and sometimes dismiss receive interrupts without
 * handling them. The driver also only receives at most 9 packets at a time,
 * which again can cause already received packets to be "hanging" in the receive
 * queue without the driver processing them.
 * In addition, prior to Linux 1.3.47, the driver incorrectly cleared the
 * overflow warning interrupt after any receive, causing it to potentially
 * miss overflow interrupts.
 *
 * The above bugs cause received packets to be lost or retransmitted by sender,
 * causing major TCP/IP performance issues when the DP8390 receives packets
 * very quickly. Other operating systems do not exhibit these bugs.
 *
 *
 * BSD Drivers
 *
 * For reasons that are not obvious, BSD drivers have configuration defaults far
 * off from the hardware defaults. For NE2000 (ne1), it is I/O base 300h and
 * IRQ 10. For WD8003E (we0), it is I/O base 280h, IRQ 9, memory D0000-D1FFF.
 * For 3C503 (ec0), it is I/O base 250h, IRQ 9, memory D8000-D9FFF (no DMA).
 *
 * The resource assigments are difficult to configure (sometimes impossible on
 * installation CDs) and the high IRQs may clash with PCI devices.
