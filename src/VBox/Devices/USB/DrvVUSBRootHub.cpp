/** @page pg_dev_vusb   VUSB - Virtual USB
 *
 * @todo read thru this and correct typos. Merge with old docs.
 *
 *
 * The Virtual USB component glues USB devices and host controllers together.
 * The VUSB takes the form of a PDM driver which is attached to the HCI. USB
 * devices are created by, attached to, and managed by the VUSB roothub. The
 * VUSB also exposes an interface which is used by Main to attach and detach
 * proxied USB devices.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_dev_vusb_urb     The Life of an URB
 *
 * The URB is created when the HCI calls the roothub (VUSB) method pfnNewUrb.
 * VUSB has a pool of URBs, if no free URBs are available a new one is
 * allocated. The returned URB starts life in the ALLOCATED state and all
 * fields are initialized with sensible defaults.
 *
 * The HCI then copies any request data into the URB if it's an host2dev
 * transfer. It then submits the URB by calling the pfnSubmitUrb roothub
 * method.
 *
 * pfnSubmitUrb will start by checking if it knows the device address, and if
 * it doesn't the URB is completed with a device-not-ready error. When the
 * device address is known to it, action is taken based on the kind of
 * transfer it is. There are four kinds of transfers: 1. control, 2. bulk,
 * 3. interrupt, and 4. isochronous. In either case something eventually ends
 * up being submitted to the device.
 *
 *
 * If an URB fails submitting, may or may not be completed. This depends on
 * heuristics in some cases and on the kind of failure in others. If
 * pfnSubmitUrb returns a failure, the HCI should retry submitting it at a
 * later time. If pfnSubmitUrb returns success the URB is submitted, and it
 * can even been completed.
 *
 * The URB is in the IN_FLIGHT state from the time it's successfully submitted
 * and till it's reaped or cancelled.
 *
 * When an URB transfer or in some case submit failure occurs, the pfnXferError
 * callback of the HCI is consulted about what to do. If pfnXferError indicates
 * that the URB should be retried, pfnSubmitUrb will fail. If it indicates that
 * it should fail, the URB will be completed.
 *
 * Completing an URB means that the URB status is set and the HCI
 * pfnXferCompletion callback is invoked with the URB. The HCI is the supposed
 * to report the transfer status to the guest OS. After completion the URB
 * is freed and returned to the pool, unless it was cancelled. If it was
 * cancelled it will have to await reaping before it's actually freed.
 *
 *
 * @subsection subsec_dev_vusb_urb_ctrl  Control
 *
 * The control transfer is the most complex one, from VUSB's point of view,
 * with its three stages and being bi-directional. A control transfer starts
 * with a SETUP packet containing the request description and two basic
 * parameters. It is followed by zero or more DATA packets which either picks
 * up incoming data (dev2host) or supplies the request data (host2dev). This
 * can then be followed by a STATUS packet which gets the status of the whole
 * transfer.
 *
 * What makes the control transfer complicated is that for a host2dev request
 * the URB is assembled from the SETUP and DATA stage, and for a dev2host
 * request the returned data must be kept around for the DATA stage. For both
 * transfer directions the status of the transfer has to be kept around for
 * the STATUS stage.
 *
 * To complicate matters further, VUSB must intercept and in some cases emulate
 * some of the standard requests in order to keep the virtual device state
 * correct and provide the correct virtualization of a device.
 *
 * @subsection subsec_dev_vusb_urb_bulk  Bulk and Interrupt
 *
 * The bulk and interrupt transfer types are relativly simple compared to the
 * control transfer. VUSB is not inspecting the request content or anything,
 * but passes it down the device.
 *
 * @subsection subsec_dev_vusb_urb_isoc  Isochronous
 *
 * This kind of transfers hasn't yet been implemented.

/** @page pg_dev_vusb_old   VUSB - Virtual USB Core
 *
 * The virtual USB core is controlled by the roothub and the underlying HCI
 * emulator, it is responsible for device addressing, managing configurations,
 * interfaces and endpoints, assembling and splitting multi-part control
 * messages and in general acts as a middle layer between the USB device
 * emulation code and USB HCI emulation code.
 *
 * All USB devices are represented by a struct vusb_dev. This structure
 * contains things like the device state, device address, all the configuration
 * descriptors, the currently selected configuration and a mapping between
 * endpoint addresses and endpoint descriptors.
 *
 * Each vusb_dev also has a pointer to a vusb_dev_ops structure which serves as
 * the virtual method table and includes a virtual constructor and destructor.
 * After a vusb_dev is created it may be attached to a hub device such as a
 * roothub (using vusbHubAttach). Although each hub structure has cPorts
 * and cDevices fields, it is the responsibility of the hub device to allocate
 * a free port for the new device.
 *
 * Devices can chose one of two interfaces for dealing with requests, the
 * synchronous interface or the asynchronous interface. The synchronous
 * interface is much simpler and ought to be used for devices which are
 * unlikely to sleep for long periods in order to serve requests. The
 * asynchronous interface on the other hand is more difficult to use but is
 * useful for the USB proxy or if one were to write a mass storage device
 * emulator. Currently the synchronous interface only supports control and bulk
 * endpoints and is no longer used by anything.
 *
 * In order to use the asynchronous interface, the queue_urb, cancel_urb and
 * pfnUrbReap fields must be set in the devices vusb_dev_ops structure. The
 * queue_urb method is used to submit a request to a device without blocking,
 * it returns 1 if successful and 0 on any kind of failure. A successfully
 * queued URB is completed when the pfnUrbReap method returns it. Each function
 * address is reference counted so that pfnUrbReap will only be called if there
 * are URBs outstanding. For a roothub to reap an URB from any one of it's
 * devices, the vusbRhReapAsyncUrbs() function is used.
 *
 * There are four types of messages an URB may contain:
 *      -# Control - represents a single packet of a multi-packet control
 *         transfer, these are only really used by the host controller to
 *         submit the parts to the usb core.
 *      -# Message - the usb core assembles multiple control transfers in
 *         to single message transfers. In this case the data buffer
 *         contains the setup packet in little endian followed by the full
 *         buffer. In the case of an host-to-device control message, the
 *         message packet is created when the STATUS transfer is seen. In
 *         the case of device-to-host  messages, the message packet is
 *         created after the SETUP transfer is seen. Also, certain control
 *         requests never go the real device and get handled synchronously.
 *      -# Bulk - Currently the only endpoint type that does error checking
 *         and endpoint halting.
 *      -# Interrupt - The only non-periodic type supported.
 *
 * Hubs are special cases of devices, they have a number of downstream ports
 * that other devices can be attached to and removed from.
 *
 * After a device has been attached (vusbHubAttach):
 *      -# The hub attach method is called, which sends a hub status
 *         change message to the OS.
 *      -# The OS resets the device, and it appears on the default
 *         address with it's config 0 selected (a pseudo-config that
 *         contains only 1 interface with 1 endpoint - the default
 *         message pipe).
 *      -# The OS assigns the device a new address and selects an
 *         appropriate config.
 *      -# The device is ready.
 *
 * After a device has been detached (vusbDevDetach):
 *      -# All pending URBs are cancelled.
 *      -# The devices address is unassigned.
 *      -# The hub detach method is called which signals the OS
 *         of the status change.
 *      -# The OS unlinks the ED's for that device.
 *
 * A device can also request detachment from within its own methods by
 * calling vusbDevUnplugged().
 *
 * Roothubs are responsible for driving the whole system, they are special
 * cases of hubs and as such implement attach and detach methods, each one
 * is described by a struct vusb_roothub. Once a roothub has submitted an
 * URB to the USB core, a number of callbacks to the roothub are required
 * for when the URB completes, since the roothub typically wants to inform
 * the OS when transfers are completed.
 *
 * There are four callbacks to be concerned with:
 *      -# prepare - This is called after the URB is successfully queued.
 *      -# completion - This is called after the URB completed.
 *      -# error - This is called if the URB errored, some systems have
 *         automatic resubmission of failed requests, so this callback
 *         should keep track of the error count and return 1 if the count
 *         is above the number of allowed resubmissions.
 *      -# halt_ep - This is called after errors on bulk pipes in order
 *         to halt the pipe.
