/** @page pg_hostclip       The Shared Clipboard Host Service
 *
 * The shared clipboard host service is the host half of the clibpoard proxying
 * between the host and the guest.  The guest parts live in VBoxClient, VBoxTray
 * and VBoxService depending on the OS, with code shared between host and guest
 * under src/VBox/GuestHost/SharedClipboard/.
 *
 * The service is split into a platform-independent core and platform-specific
 * backends.  The service defines two communication protocols - one to
 * communicate with the clipboard service running on the guest, and one to
 * communicate with the backend.  These will be described in a very skeletal
 * fashion here.
 *
 * r=bird: The "two communication protocols" does not seems to be factual, there
 * is only one protocol, the first one mentioned.  It cannot be backend
 * specific, because the guest/host protocol is platform and backend agnostic in
 * nature.  You may call it versions, but I take a great dislike to "protocol
 * versions" here, as you've just extended the existing protocol with a feature
 * that allows to transfer files and directories too.  See @bugref{9437#c39}.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_hostclip_guest_proto  The guest communication protocol
 *
 * The guest clipboard service communicates with the host service over HGCM
 * (the host is a HGCM service).  HGCM is connection based, so the guest side
 * has to connect before anything else can be done.  (Windows hosts currently
 * only support one simultaneous connection.)  Once it has connected, it can
 * send messages to the host services, some of which will receive immediate
 * replies from the host, others which will block till a reply becomes
 * available.  The latter is because HGCM does't allow the host to initiate
 * communication, it must be guest triggered.  The HGCM service is single
 * threaded, so it doesn't matter if the guest tries to send lots of requests in
 * parallel, the service will process them one at the time.
 *
 * There are currently four messages defined.  The first is
 * VBOX_SHCL_GUEST_FN_MSG_GET / VBOX_SHCL_GUEST_FN_MSG_OLD_GET_WAIT, which waits
 * for a message from the host.  If a host message is sent while the guest is
 * not waiting, it will be queued until the guest requests it.  The host code
 * only supports a single simultaneous GET call from one client guest.
 *
 * The second guest message is VBOX_SHCL_GUEST_FN_REPORT_FORMATS, which tells
 * the host that the guest has new clipboard data available.  The third is
 * VBOX_SHCL_GUEST_FN_DATA_READ, which asks the host to send its clipboard data
 * and waits until it arrives.  The host supports at most one simultaneous
 * VBOX_SHCL_GUEST_FN_DATA_READ call from a guest - if a second call is made
 * before the first has returned, the first will be aborted.
 *
 * The last guest message is VBOX_SHCL_GUEST_FN_DATA_WRITE, which is used to
 * send the contents of the guest clipboard to the host.  This call should be
 * used after the host has requested data from the guest.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_hostclip_backend_proto  The communication protocol with the
 *                                      platform-specific backend
 *
 * The initial protocol implementation (called protocol v0) was very simple,
 * and could only handle simple data (like copied text and so on). It also
 * was limited to two (2) fixed parameters at all times.
 *
 * Since VBox 6.1 a newer protocol (v1) has been established to also support
 * file transfers. This protocol uses a (per-client) message queue instead
 * (see VBOX_SHCL_GUEST_FN_MSG_OLD_GET_WAIT vs. VBOX_SHCL_GUEST_FN_GET_HOST_MSG).
 *
 * To distinguish the old (legacy) or new(er) protocol, the VBOX_SHCL_GUEST_FN_CONNECT
 * message has been introduced. If an older guest does not send this message,
 * an appropriate translation will be done to serve older Guest Additions (< 6.1).
 *
 * The protocol also support out-of-order messages by using so-called "context IDs",
 * which are generated by the host. A context ID consists of a so-called "source event ID"
 * and a so-called "event ID". Each HGCM client has an own, random, source event ID and
 * generates non-deterministic event IDs so that the guest side does not known what
 * comes next; the guest side has to reply with the same conext ID which was sent by
 * the host request.
 *
 * Also see the protocol changelog at VBoxShClSvc.h.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_uri_intro               Transferring files
 *
 * Since VBox x.x.x transferring files via Shared Clipboard is supported.
 * See the VBOX_WITH_SHARED_CLIPBOARD_TRANSFERS define for supported / enabled
 * platforms. This is called "Shared Clipboard transfers".
 *
 * Copying files / directories from guest A to guest B requires the host
 * service to act as a proxy and cache, as we don't allow direct VM-to-VM
 * communication. Copying from / to the host also is taken into account.
 *
 * At the moment a transfer is a all-or-nothing operation, e.g. it either
 * completes or fails completely. There might be callbacks in the future
 * to e.g. skip failing entries.
 *
 * Known limitations:
 *
 * - Support for VRDE (VRDP) is not implemented yet (see #9498).
 * - Unicode support on Windows hosts / guests is not enabled (yet).
 * - Symbolic links / Windows junctions are not allowed.
 * - Windows alternate data streams (ADS) are not allowed.
 * - No support for ACLs yet.
 * - No (maybe never) support for NT4.

 * @section sec_transfer_structure        Transfer handling structure
 *
 * All structures / classes are designed for running on both, on the guest
 * (via VBoxTray / VBoxClient) or on the host (host service) to avoid code
 * duplication where applicable.
 *
 * Per HGCM client there is a so-called "transfer context", which in turn can
 * have one or mulitple so-called "Shared Clipboard transfer" objects. At the
 * moment we only support on concurrent Shared Clipboard transfer per transfer
 * context. It's being used for reading from a source or writing to destination,
 * depening on its direction. An Shared Clipboard transfer can have optional
 * callbacks which might be needed by various implementations. Also, transfers
 * optionally can run in an asynchronous thread to prevent blocking the UI while
 * running.
 *
 * @section sec_transfer_providers        Transfer providers
 *
 * For certain implementations (for example on Windows guests / hosts, using
 * IDataObject and IStream objects) a more flexible approach reqarding reading /
 * writing is needed. For this so-called transfer providers abstract the way of how
 * data is being read / written in the current context (host / guest), while
 * the rest of the code stays the same.
 *
 * @section sec_transfer_protocol         Transfer protocol
 *
 * The host service issues commands which the guest has to respond with an own
 * message to. The protocol itself is designed so that it has primitives to list
 * directories and open/close/read/write file system objects.
 *
 * Note that this is different from the DnD approach, as Shared Clipboard transfers
 * need to be deeper integrated within the host / guest OS (i.e. for progress UI),
 * and this might require non-monolithic / random access APIs to achieve.
 *
 * As there can be multiple file system objects (fs objects) selected for transfer,
 * a transfer can be queried for its root entries, which then contains the top-level
 * elements. Based on these elements, (a) (recursive) listing(s) can be performed
 * to (partially) walk down into directories and query fs object information. The
 * provider provides appropriate interface for this, even if not all implementations
 * might need this mechanism.
 *
 * An Shared Clipboard transfer has three stages:
 *  - 1. Announcement: An Shared Clipboard transfer-compatible format (currently only one format available)
 *          has been announced, the destination side creates a transfer object, which then,
 *          depending on the actual implementation, can be used to tell the OS that
 *          there is transfer (file) data available.
 *          At this point this just acts as a (kind-of) promise to the OS that we
 *          can provide (file) data at some later point in time.
 *
 *  - 2. Initialization: As soon as the OS requests the (file) data, mostly triggered
 *          by the user starting a paste operation (CTRL + V), the transfer get initialized
 *          on the destination side, which in turn lets the source know that a transfer
 *          is going to happen.
 *
 *  - 3. Transfer: At this stage the actual transfer from source to the destination takes
 *          place. How the actual transfer is structurized (e.g. which files / directories
 *          are transferred in which order) depends on the destination implementation. This
 *          is necessary in order to fulfill requirements on the destination side with
 *          regards to ETA calculation or other dependencies.
 *          Both sides can abort or cancel the transfer at any time.
