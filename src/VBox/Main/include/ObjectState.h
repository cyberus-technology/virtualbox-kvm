/**
 * Thec functionality implemented by this class is the primary object state
 * (used by VirtualBoxBase and thus part of all API classes) that indicates
 * if the object is ready to serve the calls, and if not, what stage it is
 * currently at. Here is the primary state diagram:
 *
 *              +-------------------------------------------------------+
 *              |                                                       |
 *              |         (InitFailed) -----------------------+         |
 *              |              ^                              |         |
 *              v              |                              v         |
 *  [*] ---> NotReady ----> (InInit) -----> Ready -----> (InUninit) ----+
 *                     ^       |
 *                     |       v
 *                     |    Limited
 *                     |       |
 *                     +-------+
 *
 * The object is fully operational only when its state is Ready. The Limited
 * state means that only some vital part of the object is operational, and it
 * requires some sort of reinitialization to become fully operational. The
 * NotReady state means the object is basically dead: it either was not yet
 * initialized after creation at all, or was uninitialized and is waiting to be
 * destroyed when the last reference to it is released. All other states are
 * transitional.
 *
 * The NotReady->InInit->Ready, NotReady->InInit->Limited and
 * NotReady->InInit->InitFailed transition is done by the AutoInitSpan smart
 * class.
 *
 * The Limited->InInit->Ready, Limited->InInit->Limited and
 * Limited->InInit->InitFailed transition is done by the AutoReinitSpan smart
 * class.
 *
 * The Ready->InUninit->NotReady and InitFailed->InUninit->NotReady
 * transitions are done by the AutoUninitSpan smart class.
 *
 * In order to maintain the primary state integrity and declared functionality
 * the following rules apply everywhere:
 *
 * 1) Use the above Auto*Span classes to perform state transitions. See the
 *    individual class descriptions for details.
 *
 * 2) All public methods of subclasses (i.e. all methods that can be called
 *    directly, not only from within other methods of the subclass) must have a
 *    standard prolog as described in the AutoCaller and AutoLimitedCaller
 *    documentation. Alternatively, they must use #addCaller() and
 *    #releaseCaller() directly (and therefore have both the prolog and the
 *    epilog), but this is not recommended because it is easy to forget the
 *    matching release, e.g. returning before reaching the call.
