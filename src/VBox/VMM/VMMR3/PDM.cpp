/** @page   pg_pdm      PDM - The Pluggable Device & Driver Manager
 *
 * The PDM handles devices and their drivers in a flexible and dynamic manner.
 *
 * VirtualBox is designed to be very configurable, i.e. the ability to select
 * virtual devices and configure them uniquely for a VM.  For this reason
 * virtual devices are not statically linked with the VMM but loaded, linked and
 * instantiated at runtime by PDM using the information found in the
 * Configuration Manager (CFGM).
 *
 * While the chief purpose of PDM is to manager of devices their drivers, it
 * also serves as somewhere to put usful things like cross context queues, cross
 * context synchronization (like critsect), VM centric thread management,
 * asynchronous I/O framework, and so on.

 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_dev     The Pluggable Devices
 *
 * Devices register themselves when the module containing them is loaded.  PDM
 * will call the entry point 'VBoxDevicesRegister' when loading a device module.
 * The device module will then use the supplied callback table to check the VMM
 * version and to register its devices.  Each device has an unique name (within
 * the VM configuration anyway).  The name is not only used in PDM, but also in
 * CFGM to organize device and device instance settings, and by anyone who wants
 * to talk to a specific device instance.
 *
 * When all device modules have been successfully loaded PDM will instantiate
 * those devices which are configured for the VM.  Note that a device may have
 * more than one instance, take network adaptors as an example.  When
 * instantiating a device PDM provides device instance memory and a callback
 * table (aka Device Helpers / DevHlp) with the VM APIs which the device
 * instance is trusted with.
 *
 * Some devices are trusted devices, most are not.  The trusted devices are an
 * integrated part of the VM and can obtain the VM handle, thus enabling them to
 * call any VM API.  Untrusted devices can only use the callbacks provided
 * during device instantiation.
 *
 * The main purpose in having DevHlps rather than just giving all the devices
 * the VM handle and let them call the internal VM APIs directly, is both to
 * create a binary interface that can be supported across releases and to
 * create a barrier between devices and the VM.  (The trusted / untrusted bit
 * hasn't turned out to be of much use btw., but it's easy to maintain so there
 * isn't any point in removing it.)
 *
 * A device can provide a ring-0 and/or a raw-mode context extension to improve
 * the VM performance by handling exits and traps (respectively) without
 * requiring context switches (to ring-3).  Callbacks for MMIO and I/O ports
 * need to be registered specifically for the additional contexts for this to
 * make sense.  Also, the device has to be trusted to be loaded into R0/RC
 * because of the extra privilege it entails.  Note that raw-mode code and data
 * will be subject to relocation.
 *
 *
 * @subsection sec_pdm_dev_pci          PCI Devices
 *
 * A PDM device usually registers one a PCI device during it's instantiation,
 * legacy devices may register zero, while a few (currently none) more
 * complicated devices may register multiple PCI functions or devices.
 *
 * The bus, device and function assignments can either be done explictly via the
 * configuration or the registration call, or it can be left up to the PCI bus.
 * The typical VBox configuration construct (ConsoleImpl2.cpp) will do explict
 * assignments for all devices it's BusAssignmentManager class knows about.
 *
 * For explict CFGM style configuration, the "PCIBusNo", "PCIDeviceNo", and
 * "PCIFunctionNo" values in the PDM device instance configuration (not the
 * "config" subkey, but the top level one) will be picked up for the primary PCI
 * device.  The primary PCI configuration is by default the first one, but this
 * can be controlled using the @a idxDevCfg parameter of the
 * PDMDEVHLPR3::pfnPCIRegister method.  For subsequent configuration (@a
 * idxDevCfg > 0) the values are taken from the "PciDevNN" subkey, where "NN" is
 * replaced by the @a idxDevCfg value.
 *
 * There's currently a limit of 256 PCI devices per PDM device.
 *
 *
 * @subsection sec_pdm_dev_new          New Style (6.1)
 *
 * VBox 6.1 changes the PDM interface for devices and they have to be converted
 * to the new style to continue working (see @bugref{9218}).
 *
 * Steps for converting a PDM device to the new style:
 *
 * - State data needs to be split into shared, ring-3, ring-0 and raw-mode
 *   structures.  The shared structure shall contains absolutely no pointers.
 *
 * - Context specific typedefs ending in CC for the structure and pointer to
 *   it are required (copy & edit the PRTCSTATECC stuff).
 *   The pointer to a context specific structure is obtained using the
 *   PDMINS_2_DATA_CC macro.  The PDMINS_2_DATA macro gets the shared one.
 *
 * - Update the registration structure with sizeof the new structures.
 *
 * - MMIO handlers to FNIOMMMIONEWREAD and FNIOMMMIONEWRITE form, take care renaming
 *   GCPhys to off and really treat it as an offset.   Return status is VBOXSTRICTRC,
 *   which should be propagated to worker functions as far as possible.
 *
 * - I/O handlers to FNIOMIOPORTNEWIN and FNIOMIOPORTNEWOUT form, take care renaming
 *   uPort/Port to offPort and really treat it as an offset.   Return status is
 *   VBOXSTRICTRC, which should be propagated to worker functions as far as possible.
 *
 * - MMIO and I/O port registration must be converted, handles stored in the shared structure.
 *
 * - PCI devices must also update the I/O region registration and corresponding
 *   mapping callback.   The latter is generally not needed any more, as the PCI
 *   bus does the mapping and unmapping using the handle passed to it during registration.
 *
 * - If the device contains ring-0 or raw-mode optimizations:
 *    - Make sure to replace any R0Enabled, GCEnabled, and RZEnabled with
 *      pDevIns->fR0Enabled and pDevIns->fRCEnabled.  Removing CFGM reading and
 *      validation of such options as well as state members for them.
 *    - Callbacks for ring-0 and raw-mode are registered in a context contructor.
 *      Setting up of non-default critical section handling needs to be repeated
 *      in the ring-0/raw-mode context constructor too.   See for instance
 *      e1kRZConstruct().
 *
 * - Convert all PDMCritSect calls to PDMDevHlpCritSect.
 *   Note! pDevIns should be passed as parameter rather than put in pThisCC.
 *
 * - Convert all timers to the handle based ones.
 *
 * - Convert all queues to the handle based ones or tasks.
 *
 * - Set the PDM_DEVREG_FLAGS_NEW_STYLE in the registration structure.
 *   (Functionally, this only makes a difference for PDMDevHlpSetDeviceCritSect
 *   behavior, but it will become mandatory once all devices has been
 *   converted.)
 *
 * - Convert all CFGMR3Xxxx calls to pHlp->pfnCFGMXxxx.
 *
 * - Convert all SSMR3Xxxx calls to pHlp->pfnSSMXxxx.
 *
 * - Ensure that CFGM values and nodes are validated using PDMDEV_VALIDATE_CONFIG_RETURN()
 *
 * - Ensure that the first statement in the constructors is
 *   @code
           PDMDEV_CHECK_VERSIONS_RETURN(pDevIns);
     @endcode
 *   There shall be absolutely nothing preceeding that and it is mandatory.
 *
 * - Ensure that the first statement in the destructors is
 *   @code
           PDMDEV_CHECK_VERSIONS_RETURN_QUIET(pDevIns);
     @endcode
 *   There shall be absolutely nothing preceeding that and it is mandatory.
 *
 * - Use 'nm -u' (tools/win.amd64/mingw-w64/r1/bin/nm.exe on windows) to check
 *   for VBoxVMM and VMMR0 function you forgot to convert to device help calls
 *   or would need adding as device helpers or something.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_special_devs    Special Devices
 *
 * Several kinds of devices interacts with the VMM and/or other device and PDM
 * will work like a mediator for these. The typical pattern is that the device
 * calls a special registration device helper with a set of callbacks, PDM
 * responds by copying this and providing a pointer to a set helper callbacks
 * for that particular kind of device. Unlike interfaces where the callback
 * table pointer is used a 'this' pointer, these arrangements will use the
 * device instance pointer (PPDMDEVINS) as a kind of 'this' pointer.
 *
 * For an example of this kind of setup, see the PIC. The PIC registers itself
 * by calling PDMDEVHLPR3::pfnPICRegister.  PDM saves the device instance,
 * copies the callback tables (PDMPICREG), resolving the ring-0 and raw-mode
 * addresses in the process, and hands back the pointer to a set of helper
 * methods (PDMPICHLPR3).  The PCI device then queries the ring-0 and raw-mode
 * helpers using PDMPICHLPR3::pfnGetR0Helpers and PDMPICHLPR3::pfnGetRCHelpers.
 * The PCI device repeats ths pfnGetRCHelpers call in it's relocation method
 * since the address changes when RC is relocated.
 *
 * @see grp_pdm_device
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_usbdev  The Pluggable USB Devices
 *
 * USB devices are handled a little bit differently than other devices.  The
 * general concepts wrt. pluggability are mostly the same, but the details
 * varies.  The registration entry point is 'VBoxUsbRegister', the device
 * instance is PDMUSBINS and the callbacks helpers are different.  Also, USB
 * device are restricted to ring-3 and cannot have any ring-0 or raw-mode
 * extensions (at least not yet).
 *
 * The way USB devices work differs greatly from other devices though since they
 * aren't attaches directly to the PCI/ISA/whatever system buses but via a
 * USB host control (OHCI, UHCI or EHCI).  USB devices handle USB requests
 * (URBs) and does not register I/O ports, MMIO ranges or PCI bus
 * devices/functions.
 *
 * @see grp_pdm_usbdev
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_drv     The Pluggable Drivers
 *
 * The VM devices are often accessing host hardware or OS facilities.  For most
 * devices these facilities can be abstracted in one or more levels.  These
 * abstractions are called drivers.
 *
 * For instance take a DVD/CD drive.  This can be connected to a SCSI
 * controller, an ATA controller or a SATA controller.  The basics of the DVD/CD
 * drive implementation remains the same - eject, insert, read, seek, and such.
 * (For the scsi SCSCI, you might want to speak SCSI directly to, but that can of
 * course be fixed - see SCSI passthru.)  So, it
 * makes much sense to have a generic CD/DVD driver which implements this.
 *
 * Then the media 'inserted' into the DVD/CD drive can be a ISO image, or it can
 * be read from a real CD or DVD drive (there are probably other custom formats
 * someone could desire to read or construct too).  So, it would make sense to
 * have abstracted interfaces for dealing with this in a generic way so the
 * cdrom unit doesn't have to implement it all.  Thus we have created the
 * CDROM/DVD media driver family.
 *
 * So, for this example the IDE controller #1 (i.e. secondary) will have
 * the DVD/CD Driver attached to it's LUN #0 (master).  When a media is mounted
 * the DVD/CD Driver will have a ISO, HostDVD or RAW (media) Driver attached.
 *
 * It is possible to configure many levels of drivers inserting filters, loggers,
 * or whatever you desire into the chain.  We're using this for network sniffing,
 * for instance.
 *
 * The drivers are loaded in a similar manner to that of a device, namely by
 * iterating a keyspace in CFGM, load the modules listed there and call
 * 'VBoxDriversRegister' with a callback table.
 *
 * @see grp_pdm_driver
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_ifs     Interfaces
 *
 * The pluggable drivers and devices expose one standard interface (callback
 * table) which is used to construct, destruct, attach, detach,( ++,) and query
 * other interfaces. A device will query the interfaces required for it's
 * operation during init and hot-plug.  PDM may query some interfaces during
 * runtime mounting too.
 *
 * An interface here means a function table contained within the device or
 * driver instance data. Its methods are invoked with the function table pointer
 * as the first argument and they will calculate the address of the device or
 * driver instance data from it. (This is one of the aspects which *might* have
 * been better done in C++.)
 *
 * @see grp_pdm_interfaces
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_utils   Utilities
 *
 * As mentioned earlier, PDM is the location of any usful constructs that doesn't
 * quite fit into IPRT. The next subsections will discuss these.
 *
 * One thing these APIs all have in common is that resources will be associated
 * with a device / driver and automatically freed after it has been destroyed if
 * the destructor didn't do this.
 *
 *
 * @subsection sec_pdm_async_completion     Async I/O
 *
 * The PDM Async I/O API provides a somewhat platform agnostic interface for
 * asynchronous I/O.  For reasons of performance and complexity this does not
 * build upon any IPRT API.
 *
 * @todo more details.
 *
 * @see grp_pdm_async_completion
 *
 *
 * @subsection sec_pdm_async_task   Async Task - not implemented
 *
 * @todo implement and describe
 *
 * @see grp_pdm_async_task
 *
 *
 * @subsection sec_pdm_critsect     Critical Section
 *
 * The PDM Critical Section API is currently building on the IPRT API with the
 * same name.  It adds the possibility to use critical sections in ring-0 and
 * raw-mode as well as in ring-3.  There are certain restrictions on the RC and
 * R0 usage though since we're not able to wait on it, nor wake up anyone that
 * is waiting on it.  These restrictions origins with the use of a ring-3 event
 * semaphore.  In a later incarnation we plan to replace the ring-3 event
 * semaphore with a ring-0 one, thus enabling us to wake up waiters while
 * exectuing in ring-0 and making the hardware assisted execution mode more
 * efficient. (Raw-mode won't benefit much from this, naturally.)
 *
 * @see grp_pdm_critsect
 *
 *
 * @subsection sec_pdm_queue        Queue
 *
 * The PDM Queue API is for queuing one or more tasks for later consumption in
 * ring-3 by EMT, and optionally forcing a delayed or ASAP return to ring-3.  The
 * queues can also be run on a timer basis as an alternative to the ASAP thing.
 * The queue will be flushed at forced action time.
 *
 * A queue can also be used by another thread (a I/O worker for instance) to
 * send work / events over to the EMT.
 *
 * @see grp_pdm_queue
 *
 *
 * @subsection sec_pdm_task        Task - not implemented yet
 *
 * The PDM Task API is for flagging a task for execution at a later point when
 * we're back in ring-3, optionally forcing the ring-3 return to happen ASAP.
 * As you can see the concept is similar to queues only simpler.
 *
 * A task can also be scheduled by another thread (a I/O worker for instance) as
 * a mean of getting something done in EMT.
 *
 * @see grp_pdm_task
 *
 *
 * @subsection sec_pdm_thread       Thread
 *
 * The PDM Thread API is there to help devices and drivers manage their threads
 * correctly wrt. power on, suspend, resume, power off and destruction.
 *
 * The general usage pattern for threads in the employ of devices and drivers is
 * that they shuffle data or requests while the VM is running and stop doing
 * this when the VM is paused or powered down. Rogue threads running while the
 * VM is paused can cause the state to change during saving or have other
 * unwanted side effects. The PDM Threads API ensures that this won't happen.
 *
 * @see grp_pdm_thread
