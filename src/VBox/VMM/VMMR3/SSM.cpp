/** @page pg_ssm        SSM - The Saved State Manager
 *
 * The Saved State Manager (SSM) implements facilities for saving and loading a
 * VM state in a structural manner using callbacks for named data units.
 *
 * At init time each of the VMM components, Devices, Drivers and one or two
 * other things will register data units which they need to save and restore.
 * Each unit have a unique name (ascii), instance number, and a set of callbacks
 * associated with it.  The name will be used to identify the unit during
 * restore.  The callbacks are for the two operations, save and restore.  There
 * are three callbacks for each of the two - a prepare, a execute and a complete
 * - giving each component ample opportunity to perform actions both before and
 * afterwards.
 *
 * The SSM provides a number of APIs for encoding and decoding the data: @see
 * grp_ssm
 *
 *
 *
 * @section sec_ssm_live_snapshots  Live Snapshots
 *
 * The live snapshots feature (LS) is similar to teleportation (TP) and was a
 * natural first step when implementing TP.  The main differences between LS and
 * TP are that after a live snapshot we will have a saved state file, disk image
 * snapshots, and the VM will still be running.
 *
 * Compared to normal saved stated and snapshots, the difference is in that the
 * VM is running while we do most of the saving.  Prior to LS, there was only
 * one round of callbacks during saving and the VM was paused during it.  With
 * LS there are 1 or more passes while the VM is still running and a final one
 * after it has been paused.  The runtime passes are executed on a dedicated
 * thread running at at the same priority as the EMTs so that the saving doesn't
 * starve or lose in scheduling questions (note: not implemented yet). The final
 * pass is done on EMT(0).
 *
 * There are a couple of common reasons why LS and TP will fail:
 *   - Memory configuration changed (PCI memory mappings).
 *   - Takes too long (TP) / Too much output (LS).
 *
 *
 * The live saving sequence is something like this:
 *
 *      -# SSMR3LiveSave is called on EMT0.  It returns a saved state
 *         handle.
 *      -# SSMR3LiveDoStep1 is called on a non-EMT.  This will save the major
 *         parts of the state while the VM may still be running.
 *      -# The VM is suspended.
 *      -# SSMR3LiveDoStep2 is called on EMT0 to save the remainder of the state
 *         in the normal way.
 *      -# The client does any necessary reconfiguration of harddisks and
 *         similar.
 *      -# SSMR3LiveDone is called on EMT0 to close the handle.
 *      -# The VM is resumed or powered off and destroyed.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_ssm_teleportation   Teleportation
 *
 * As mentioned in the previous section, the main differences between this and
 * live snapshots are in where the saved state is written and what state the
 * local VM is in afterwards - at least from the VMM point of view.  The
 * necessary administrative work - establishing the connection to the remote
 * machine, cloning the VM config on it and doing lowlevel saved state data
 * transfer - is taken care of by layer above the VMM (i.e.  Main).
 *
 * The SSM data format was made streamable for the purpose of teleportation
 * (v1.2 was the last non-streamable version).
 *
 *
 * @section sec_ssm_format          Saved State Format
 *
 * The stream format starts with a header (SSMFILEHDR) that indicates the
 * version and such things, it is followed by zero or more saved state units
 * (name + instance + pass), and the stream concludes with a footer
 * (SSMFILEFTR) that contains unit counts and optionally a checksum for the
 * entire file.  (In version 1.2 and earlier, the checksum was in the header and
 * there was no footer.  This meant that the header was updated after the entire
 * file was written.)
 *
 * The saved state units each starts with a variable sized header
 * (SSMFILEUNITHDRV2) that contains the name, instance and pass.  The data
 * follows the header and is encoded as records with a 2-8 byte record header
 * indicating the type, flags and size.  The first byte in the record header
 * indicates the type and flags:
 *
 *   - bits 0..3: Record type:
 *       - type 0: Invalid.
 *       - type 1: Terminator with CRC-32 and unit size.
 *       - type 2: Raw data record.
 *       - type 3: Raw data compressed by LZF. The data is prefixed by a 8-bit
 *                 field containing the length of the uncompressed data given in
 *                 1KB units.
 *       - type 4: Zero data. The record header is followed by a 8-bit field
 *                 counting the length of the zero data given in 1KB units.
 *       - type 5: Named data - length prefixed name followed by the data. This
 *                 type is not implemented yet as we're missing the API part, so
 *                 the type assignment is tentative.
 *       - types 6 thru 15 are current undefined.
 *   - bit 4: Important (set), can be skipped (clear).
 *   - bit 5: Undefined flag, must be zero.
 *   - bit 6: Undefined flag, must be zero.
 *   - bit 7: "magic" bit, always set.
 *
 * Record header byte 2 (optionally thru 7) is the size of the following data
 * encoded in UTF-8 style.  To make buffering simpler and more efficient during
 * the save operation, the strict checks enforcing optimal encoding has been
 * relaxed for the 2 and 3 byte encodings.
 *
 * (In version 1.2 and earlier the unit data was compressed and not record
 * based. The unit header contained the compressed size of the data, i.e. it
 * needed updating after the data was written.)
 *
 *
 * @section sec_ssm_future          Future Changes
 *
 * There are plans to extend SSM to make it easier to be both backwards and
 * (somewhat) forwards compatible.  One of the new features will be being able
 * to classify units and data items as unimportant (added to the format in
 * v2.0).  Another suggested feature is naming data items (also added to the
 * format in v2.0), perhaps by extending the SSMR3PutStruct API.  Both features
 * will require API changes, the naming may possibly require both buffering of
 * the stream as well as some helper managing them.
