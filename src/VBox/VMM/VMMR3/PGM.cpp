 * @section         sec_pgm_modes           Paging Modes
 *
 * There are three memory contexts: Host Context (HC), Guest Context (GC)
 * and intermediate context.  When talking about paging HC can also be referred
 * to as "host paging", and GC referred to as "shadow paging".
 *
 * We define three basic paging modes: 32-bit, PAE and AMD64. The host paging mode
 * is defined by the host operating system. The mode used in the shadow paging mode
 * depends on the host paging mode and what the mode the guest is currently in. The
 * following relation between the two is defined:
 *
 * @verbatim
     Host > 32-bit |  PAE   | AMD64  |
   Guest  |        |        |        |
   ==v================================

   PAE       PAE      PAE     PAE
   -------|--------|--------|--------|

   -------|--------|--------|--------| @endverbatim
 *
 * All configuration except those in the diagonal (upper left) are expected to
 * require special effort from the switcher (i.e. a bit slower).
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * @section         sec_pgm_shw             The Shadow Memory Context
 *
 *
 *  [..]
 *
 * Because of guest context mappings requires PDPT and PML4 entries to allow
 * writing on AMD64, the two upper levels will have fixed flags whatever the
 * guest is thinking of using there. So, when shadowing the PD level we will
 * calculate the effective flags of PD and all the higher levels. In legacy
 * PAE mode this only applies to the PWT and PCD bits (the rest are
 * ignored/reserved/MBZ). We will ignore those bits for the present.
 *
 *
 *
 * @section         sec_pgm_int             The Intermediate Memory Context
 *
 * The world switch goes thru an intermediate memory context which purpose it is
 * to provide different mappings of the switcher code. All guest mappings are also
 * present in this context.
 *
 * The switcher code is mapped at the same location as on the host, at an
 * identity mapped location (physical equals virtual address), and at the
 * hypervisor location. The identity mapped location is for when the world
 * switches that involves disabling paging.
 *
 * PGM maintain page tables for 32-bit, PAE and AMD64 paging modes. This
 * simplifies switching guest CPU mode and consistency at the cost of more
 * code to do the work. All memory use for those page tables is located below
 * 4GB (this includes page tables for guest context mappings).
 *
 * Note! The intermediate memory context is also used for 64-bit guest
 *       execution on 32-bit hosts.  Because we need to load 64-bit registers
 *       prior to switching to guest context, we need to be in 64-bit mode
 *       first.  So, HM has some 64-bit worker routines in VMMRC.rc that get
 *       invoked via the special world switcher code in LegacyToAMD64.asm.
 *
 *
 * @subsection      subsec_pgm_int_gc       Guest Context Mappings
 *
 * During assignment and relocation of a guest context mapping the intermediate
 * memory context is used to verify the new location.
 *
 * Guest context mappings are currently restricted to below 4GB, for reasons
 * of simplicity. This may change when we implement AMD64 support.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * @section         sec_pgm_misc            Misc
 *
 *
 * @subsection      sec_pgm_misc_A20        The A20 Gate
 *
 * PGM implements the A20 gate masking when translating a virtual guest address
 * into a physical address for CPU access, i.e. PGMGstGetPage (and friends) and
 * the code reading the guest page table entries during shadowing.  The masking
 * is done consistenly for all CPU modes, paged ones included.  Large pages are
 * also masked correctly.  (On current CPUs, experiments indicates that AMD does
 * not apply A20M in paged modes and intel only does it for the 2nd MB of
 * memory.)
 *
 * The A20 gate implementation is per CPU core.  It can be configured on a per
 * core basis via the keyboard device and PC architecture device.  This is
 * probably not exactly how real CPUs do it, but SMP and A20 isn't a place where
 * guest OSes try pushing things anyway, so who cares.  (On current real systems
 * the A20M signal is probably only sent to the boot CPU and it affects all
 * thread and probably all cores in that package.)
 *
 * The keyboard device and the PC architecture device doesn't OR their A20
 * config bits together, rather they are currently implemented such that they
 * mirror the CPU state.  So, flipping the bit in either of them will change the
 * A20 state.  (On real hardware the bits of the two devices should probably be
 * ORed together to indicate enabled, i.e. both needs to be cleared to disable
 * A20 masking.)
 *
 * The A20 state will change immediately, transmeta fashion.  There is no delays
 * due to buses, wiring or other physical stuff.  (On real hardware there are
 * normally delays, the delays differs between the two devices and probably also
 * between chipsets and CPU generations. Note that it's said that transmeta CPUs
 * does the change immediately like us, they apparently intercept/handles the
 * port accesses in microcode. Neat.)

 *
 * @subsection      subsec_pgm_misc_diff    Differences Between Legacy PAE and Long Mode PAE
 *
 * The differences between legacy PAE and long mode PAE are:
 *      -# PDPE bits 1, 2, 5 and 6 are defined differently. In leagcy mode they are
 *         all marked down as must-be-zero, while in long mode 1, 2 and 5 have the
 *         usual meanings while 6 is ignored (AMD). This means that upon switching to
 *         legacy PAE mode we'll have to clear these bits and when going to long mode
 *         they must be set. This applies to both intermediate and shadow contexts,
 *         however we don't need to do it for the intermediate one since we're
 *         executing with CR0.WP at that time.
 *      -# CR3 allows a 32-byte aligned address in legacy mode, while in long mode
 *         a page aligned one is required.

 *
 * @subsection      sec_pgm_handlers_phys   Physical Access Handlers
 *
 * Placeholder.
 *
 *
 * @subsection      sec_pgm_handlers_virt   Virtual Access Handlers (obsolete)
 *
 * We currently implement three types of virtual access handlers:  ALL, WRITE
 * and HYPERVISOR (WRITE). See PGMVIRTHANDLERKIND for some more details.
 *
 * The HYPERVISOR access handlers is kept in a separate tree since it doesn't apply
 * to physical pages (PGMTREES::HyperVirtHandlers) and only needs to be consulted in
 * a special \#PF case. The ALL and WRITE are in the PGMTREES::VirtHandlers tree, the
 * rest of this section is going to be about these handlers.
 *
 * We'll go thru the life cycle of a handler and try make sense of it all, don't know
 * how successful this is gonna be...
 *
 * 1. A handler is registered thru the PGMR3HandlerVirtualRegister and
 * PGMHandlerVirtualRegisterEx APIs. We check for conflicting virtual handlers
 * and create a new node that is inserted into the AVL tree (range key). Then
 * a full PGM resync is flagged (clear pool, sync cr3, update virtual bit of PGMPAGE).
 *
 * 2. The following PGMSyncCR3/SyncCR3 operation will first make invoke HandlerVirtualUpdate.
 *
 * 2a. HandlerVirtualUpdate will will lookup all the pages covered by virtual handlers
 * via the current guest CR3 and update the physical page -> virtual handler
 * translation. Needless to say, this doesn't exactly scale very well. If any changes
 * are detected, it will flag a virtual bit update just like we did on registration.
 * PGMPHYS pages with changes will have their virtual handler state reset to NONE.
 *
 * 2b. The virtual bit update process will iterate all the pages covered by all the
 * virtual handlers and update the PGMPAGE virtual handler state to the max of all
 * virtual handlers on that page.
 *
 * 2c. Back in SyncCR3 we will now flush the entire shadow page cache to make sure
 * we don't miss any alias mappings of the monitored pages.
 *
 * 2d. SyncCR3 will then proceed with syncing the CR3 table.
 *
 * 3. \#PF(np,read) on a page in the range. This will cause it to be synced
 * read-only and resumed if it's a WRITE handler. If it's an ALL handler we
 * will call the handlers like in the next step. If the physical mapping has
 * changed we will - some time in the future - perform a handler callback
 * (optional) and update the physical -> virtual handler cache.
 *
 * 4. \#PF(,write) on a page in the range. This will cause the handler to
 * be invoked.
 *
 * 5. The guest invalidates the page and changes the physical backing or
 * unmaps it. This should cause the invalidation callback to be invoked
 * (it might not yet be 100% perfect). Exactly what happens next... is
 * this where we mess up and end up out of sync for a while?
 *
 * 6. The handler is deregistered by the client via PGMHandlerVirtualDeregister.
 * We will then set all PGMPAGEs in the physical -> virtual handler cache for
 * this handler to NONE and trigger a full PGM resync (basically the same
 * as int step 1). Which means 2 is executed again.
 *
 *
 * @subsubsection   sub_sec_pgm_handler_virt_todo   TODOs
 *
 * There is a bunch of things that needs to be done to make the virtual handlers
 * work 100% correctly and work more efficiently.
 *
 * The first bit hasn't been implemented yet because it's going to slow the
 * whole mess down even more, and besides it seems to be working reliably for
 * our current uses. OTOH, some of the optimizations might end up more or less
 * implementing the missing bits, so we'll see.
 *
 * On the optimization side, the first thing to do is to try avoid unnecessary
 * cache flushing. Then try team up with the shadowing code to track changes
 * in mappings by means of access to them (shadow in), updates to shadows pages,
 * invlpg, and shadow PT discarding (perhaps).
 *
 * Some idea that have popped up for optimization for current and new features:
 *    - bitmap indicating where there are virtual handlers installed.
 *      (4KB => 2**20 pages, page 2**12 => covers 32-bit address space 1:1!)
 *    - Further optimize this by min/max (needs min/max avl getters).
 *    - Shadow page table entry bit (if any left)?

/** @page pg_pgm_phys   PGM Physical Guest Memory Management
 *
 *
 * Objectives:
 *      - Guest RAM over-commitment using memory ballooning,
 *        zero pages and general page sharing.
 *      - Moving or mirroring a VM onto a different physical machine.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pgmPhys_Definitions       Definitions
 *
 * Allocation chunk - A RTR0MemObjAllocPhysNC or RTR0MemObjAllocPhys allocate
 * memory object and the tracking machinery associated with it.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pgmPhys_AllocPage         Allocating a page.
 *
 * Initially we map *all* guest memory to the (per VM) zero page, which
 * means that none of the read functions will cause pages to be allocated.
 *
 * Exception, access bit in page tables that have been shared. This must
 * be handled, but we must also make sure PGMGst*Modify doesn't make
 * unnecessary modifications.
 *
 * Allocation points:
 *      - PGMPhysSimpleWriteGCPhys and PGMPhysWrite.
 *      - Replacing a zero page mapping at \#PF.
 *      - Replacing a shared page mapping at \#PF.
 *      - ROM registration (currently MMR3RomRegister).
 *      - VM restore (pgmR3Load).
 *
 * For the first three it would make sense to keep a few pages handy
 * until we've reached the max memory commitment for the VM.
 *
 * For the ROM registration, we know exactly how many pages we need
 * and will request these from ring-0. For restore, we will save
 * the number of non-zero pages in the saved state and allocate
 * them up front. This would allow the ring-0 component to refuse
 * the request if the isn't sufficient memory available for VM use.
 *
 * Btw. for both ROM and restore allocations we won't be requiring
 * zeroed pages as they are going to be filled instantly.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pgmPhys_FreePage          Freeing a page
 *
 * There are a few points where a page can be freed:
 *      - After being replaced by the zero page.
 *      - After being replaced by a shared page.
 *      - After being ballooned by the guest additions.
 *      - At reset.
 *      - At restore.
 *
 * When freeing one or more pages they will be returned to the ring-0
 * component and replaced by the zero page.
 *
 * The reasoning for clearing out all the pages on reset is that it will
 * return us to the exact same state as on power on, and may thereby help
 * us reduce the memory load on the system. Further it might have a
 * (temporary) positive influence on memory fragmentation (@see subsec_pgmPhys_Fragmentation).
 *
 * On restore, as mention under the allocation topic, pages should be
 * freed / allocated depending on how many is actually required by the
 * new VM state. The simplest approach is to do like on reset, and free
 * all non-ROM pages and then allocate what we need.
 *
 * A measure to prevent some fragmentation, would be to let each allocation
 * chunk have some affinity towards the VM having allocated the most pages
 * from it. Also, try make sure to allocate from allocation chunks that
 * are almost full. Admittedly, both these measures might work counter to
 * our intentions and its probably not worth putting a lot of effort,
 * cpu time or memory into this.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pgmPhys_SharePage         Sharing a page
 *
 * The basic idea is that there there will be a idle priority kernel
 * thread walking the non-shared VM pages hashing them and looking for
 * pages with the same checksum. If such pages are found, it will compare
 * them byte-by-byte to see if they actually are identical. If found to be
 * identical it will allocate a shared page, copy the content, check that
 * the page didn't change while doing this, and finally request both the
 * VMs to use the shared page instead. If the page is all zeros (special
 * checksum and byte-by-byte check) it will request the VM that owns it
 * to replace it with the zero page.
 *
 * To make this efficient, we will have to make sure not to try share a page
 * that will change its contents soon. This part requires the most work.
 * A simple idea would be to request the VM to write monitor the page for
 * a while to make sure it isn't modified any time soon. Also, it may
 * make sense to skip pages that are being write monitored since this
 * information is readily available to the thread if it works on the
 * per-VM guest memory structures (presently called PGMRAMRANGE).
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pgmPhys_Fragmentation     Fragmentation Concerns and Counter Measures
 *
 * The pages are organized in allocation chunks in ring-0, this is a necessity
 * if we wish to have an OS agnostic approach to this whole thing. (On Linux we
 * could easily work on a page-by-page basis if we liked. Whether this is possible
 * or efficient on NT I don't quite know.) Fragmentation within these chunks may
 * become a problem as part of the idea here is that we wish to return memory to
 * the host system.
 *
 * For instance, starting two VMs at the same time, they will both allocate the
 * guest memory on-demand and if permitted their page allocations will be
 * intermixed. Shut down one of the two VMs and it will be difficult to return
 * any memory to the host system because the page allocation for the two VMs are
 * mixed up in the same allocation chunks.
 *
 * To further complicate matters, when pages are freed because they have been
 * ballooned or become shared/zero the whole idea is that the page is supposed
 * to be reused by another VM or returned to the host system. This will cause
 * allocation chunks to contain pages belonging to different VMs and prevent
 * returning memory to the host when one of those VM shuts down.
 *
 * The only way to really deal with this problem is to move pages. This can
 * either be done at VM shutdown and or by the idle priority worker thread
 * that will be responsible for finding sharable/zero pages. The mechanisms
 * involved for coercing a VM to move a page (or to do it for it) will be
 * the same as when telling it to share/zero a page.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pgmPhys_Tracking      Tracking Structures And Their Cost
 *
 * There's a difficult balance between keeping the per-page tracking structures
 * (global and guest page) easy to use and keeping them from eating too much
 * memory. We have limited virtual memory resources available when operating in
 * 32-bit kernel space (on 64-bit there'll it's quite a different story). The
 * tracking structures will be attempted designed such that we can deal with up
 * to 32GB of memory on a 32-bit system and essentially unlimited on 64-bit ones.
 *
 *
 * @subsection subsec_pgmPhys_Tracking_Kernel     Kernel Space
 *
 * @see pg_GMM
 *
 * @subsection subsec_pgmPhys_Tracking_PerVM      Per-VM
 *
 * Fixed info is the physical address of the page (HCPhys) and the page id
 * (described above). Theoretically we'll need 48(-12) bits for the HCPhys part.
 * Today we've restricting ourselves to 40(-12) bits because this is the current
 * restrictions of all AMD64 implementations (I think Barcelona will up this
 * to 48(-12) bits, not that it really matters) and I needed the bits for
 * tracking mappings of a page. 48-12 = 36. That leaves 28 bits, which means a
 * decent range for the page id: 2^(28+12) = 1024TB.
 *
 * In additions to these, we'll have to keep maintaining the page flags as we
 * currently do. Although it wouldn't harm to optimize these quite a bit, like
 * for instance the ROM shouldn't depend on having a write handler installed
 * in order for it to become read-only. A RO/RW bit should be considered so
 * that the page syncing code doesn't have to mess about checking multiple
 * flag combinations (ROM || RW handler || write monitored) in order to
 * figure out how to setup a shadow PTE. But this of course, is second
 * priority at present. Current this requires 12 bits, but could probably
 * be optimized to ~8.
 *
 * Then there's the 24 bits used to track which shadow page tables are
 * currently mapping a page for the purpose of speeding up physical
 * access handlers, and thereby the page pool cache. More bit for this
 * purpose wouldn't hurt IIRC.
 *
 * Then there is a new bit in which we need to record what kind of page
 * this is, shared, zero, normal or write-monitored-normal. This'll
 * require 2 bits. One bit might be needed for indicating whether a
 * write monitored page has been written to. And yet another one or
 * two for tracking migration status. 3-4 bits total then.
 *
 * Whatever is left will can be used to record the sharabilitiy of a
 * page. The page checksum will not be stored in the per-VM table as
 * the idle thread will not be permitted to do modifications to it.
 * It will instead have to keep its own working set of potentially
 * shareable pages and their check sums and stuff.
 *
 * For the present we'll keep the current packing of the
 * PGMRAMRANGE::aHCPhys to keep the changes simple, only of course,
 * we'll have to change it to a struct with a total of 128-bits at
 * our disposal.
 *
 * The initial layout will be like this:
 * @verbatim
    RTHCPHYS HCPhys;            The current stuff.
        63:40                   Current shadow PT tracking stuff.
        39:12                   The physical page frame number.
        11:0                    The current flags.
    uint32_t u28PageId : 28;    The page id.
    uint32_t u2State : 2;       The page state { zero, shared, normal, write monitored }.
    uint32_t fWrittenTo : 1;    Whether a write monitored page was written to.
    uint32_t u1Reserved : 1;    Reserved for later.
    uint32_t u32Reserved;       Reserved for later, mostly sharing stats.
 @endverbatim
 *
 * The final layout will be something like this:
 * @verbatim
    RTHCPHYS HCPhys;            The current stuff.
        63:48                   High page id (12+).
        47:12                   The physical page frame number.
        11:0                    Low page id.
    uint32_t fReadOnly : 1;     Whether it's readonly page (rom or monitored in some way).
    uint32_t u3Type : 3;        The page type {RESERVED, MMIO, MMIO2, ROM, shadowed ROM, RAM}.
    uint32_t u2PhysMon : 2;     Physical access handler type {none, read, write, all}.
    uint32_t u2VirtMon : 2;     Virtual access handler type {none, read, write, all}..
    uint32_t u2State : 2;       The page state { zero, shared, normal, write monitored }.
    uint32_t fWrittenTo : 1;    Whether a write monitored page was written to.
    uint32_t u20Reserved : 20;  Reserved for later, mostly sharing stats.
    uint32_t u32Tracking;       The shadow PT tracking stuff, roughly.
 @endverbatim
 *
 * Cost wise, this means we'll double the cost for guest memory. There isn't anyway
 * around that I'm afraid. It means that the cost of dealing out 32GB of memory
 * to one or more VMs is: (32GB >> GUEST_PAGE_SHIFT) * 16 bytes, or 128MBs. Or
 * another example, the VM heap cost when assigning 1GB to a VM will be: 4MB.
 *
 * A couple of cost examples for the total cost per-VM + kernel.
 * 32-bit Windows and 32-bit linux:
 *      1GB guest ram, 256K pages:  4MB +  2MB(+) =   6MB
 *      4GB guest ram, 1M pages:   16MB +  8MB(+) =  24MB
 *     32GB guest ram, 8M pages:  128MB + 64MB(+) = 192MB
 * 64-bit Windows and 64-bit linux:
 *      1GB guest ram, 256K pages:  4MB +  3MB(+) =   7MB
 *      4GB guest ram, 1M pages:   16MB + 12MB(+) =  28MB
 *     32GB guest ram, 8M pages:  128MB + 96MB(+) = 224MB
 *
 * UPDATE - 2007-09-27:
 * Will need a ballooned flag/state too because we cannot
 * trust the guest 100% and reporting the same page as ballooned more
 * than once will put the GMM off balance.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pgmPhys_Serializing       Serializing Access
 *
 * Initially, we'll try a simple scheme:
 *
 *      - The per-VM RAM tracking structures (PGMRAMRANGE) is only modified
 *        by the EMT thread of that VM while in the pgm critsect.
 *      - Other threads in the VM process that needs to make reliable use of
 *        the per-VM RAM tracking structures will enter the critsect.
 *      - No process external thread or kernel thread will ever try enter
 *        the pgm critical section, as that just won't work.
 *      - The idle thread (and similar threads) doesn't not need 100% reliable
 *        data when performing it tasks as the EMT thread will be the one to
 *        do the actual changes later anyway. So, as long as it only accesses
 *        the main ram range, it can do so by somehow preventing the VM from
 *        being destroyed while it works on it...
 *
 *      - The over-commitment management, including the allocating/freeing
 *        chunks, is serialized by a ring-0 mutex lock (a fast one since the
 *        more mundane mutex implementation is broken on Linux).
 *      - A separate mutex is protecting the set of allocation chunks so
 *        that pages can be shared or/and freed up while some other VM is
 *        allocating more chunks. This mutex can be take from under the other
 *        one, but not the other way around.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pgmPhys_Request           VM Request interface
 *
 * When in ring-0 it will become necessary to send requests to a VM so it can
 * for instance move a page while defragmenting during VM destroy. The idle
 * thread will make use of this interface to request VMs to setup shared
 * pages and to perform write monitoring of pages.
 *
 * I would propose an interface similar to the current VMReq interface, similar
 * in that it doesn't require locking and that the one sending the request may
 * wait for completion if it wishes to. This shouldn't be very difficult to
 * realize.
 *
 * The requests themselves are also pretty simple. They are basically:
 *      -# Check that some precondition is still true.
 *      -# Do the update.
 *      -# Update all shadow page tables involved with the page.
 *
 * The 3rd step is identical to what we're already doing when updating a
 * physical handler, see pgmHandlerPhysicalSetRamFlagsAndFlushShadowPTs.
 *
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pgmPhys_MappingCaches   Mapping Caches
 *
 * In order to be able to map in and out memory and to be able to support
 * guest with more RAM than we've got virtual address space, we'll employing
 * a mapping cache.  Normally ring-0 and ring-3 can share the same cache,
 * however on 32-bit darwin the ring-0 code is running in a different memory
 * context and therefore needs a separate cache.  In raw-mode context we also
 * need a separate cache.  The 32-bit darwin mapping cache and the one for
 * raw-mode context share a lot of code, see PGMRZDYNMAP.
 *
 *
 * @subsection subsec_pgmPhys_MappingCaches_R3  Ring-3

 * We've considered implementing the ring-3 mapping cache page based but found
 * that this was bother some when one had to take into account TLBs+SMP and
 * portability (missing the necessary APIs on several platforms). There were
 * also some performance concerns with this approach which hadn't quite been
 * worked out.
 *
 * Instead, we'll be mapping allocation chunks into the VM process. This simplifies
 * matters greatly quite a bit since we don't need to invent any new ring-0 stuff,
 * only some minor RTR0MEMOBJ mapping stuff. The main concern here is that mapping
 * compared to the previous idea is that mapping or unmapping a 1MB chunk is more
 * costly than a single page, although how much more costly is uncertain. We'll
 * try address this by using a very big cache, preferably bigger than the actual
 * VM RAM size if possible. The current VM RAM sizes should give some idea for
 * 32-bit boxes, while on 64-bit we can probably get away with employing an
 * unlimited cache.
 *
 * The cache have to parts, as already indicated, the ring-3 side and the
 * ring-0 side.
 *
 * The ring-0 will be tied to the page allocator since it will operate on the
 * memory objects it contains. It will therefore require the first ring-0 mutex
 * discussed in @ref sec_pgmPhys_Serializing.  We some double house keeping wrt
 * to who has mapped what I think, since both VMMR0.r0 and RTR0MemObj will keep
 * track of mapping relations
 *
 * The ring-3 part will be protected by the pgm critsect. For simplicity, we'll
 * require anyone that desires to do changes to the mapping cache to do that
 * from within this critsect. Alternatively, we could employ a separate critsect
 * for serializing changes to the mapping cache as this would reduce potential
 * contention with other threads accessing mappings unrelated to the changes
 * that are in process. We can see about this later, contention will show
 * up in the statistics anyway, so it'll be simple to tell.
 *
 * The organization of the ring-3 part will be very much like how the allocation
 * chunks are organized in ring-0, that is in an AVL tree by chunk id. To avoid
 * having to walk the tree all the time, we'll have a couple of lookaside entries
 * like in we do for I/O ports and MMIO in IOM.
 *
 * The simplified flow of a PGMPhysRead/Write function:
 *      -# Enter the PGM critsect.
 *      -# Lookup GCPhys in the ram ranges and get the Page ID.
 *      -# Calc the Allocation Chunk ID from the Page ID.
 *      -# Check the lookaside entries and then the AVL tree for the Chunk ID.
 *         If not found in cache:
 *              -# Call ring-0 and request it to be mapped and supply
 *                 a chunk to be unmapped if the cache is maxed out already.
 *              -# Insert the new mapping into the AVL tree (id + R3 address).
 *      -# Update the relevant lookaside entry and return the mapping address.
 *      -# Do the read/write according to monitoring flags and everything.
 *      -# Leave the critsect.
 *

 * Breakdown of the changes involved?
