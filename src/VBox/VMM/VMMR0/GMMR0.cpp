/** @page pg_gmm    GMM - The Global Memory Manager
 *
 * As the name indicates, this component is responsible for global memory
 * management. Currently only guest RAM is allocated from the GMM, but this
 * may change to include shadow page tables and other bits later.
 *
 * Guest RAM is managed as individual pages, but allocated from the host OS
 * in chunks for reasons of portability / efficiency. To minimize the memory
 * footprint all tracking structure must be as small as possible without
 * unnecessary performance penalties.
 *
 * The allocation chunks has fixed sized, the size defined at compile time
 * by the #GMM_CHUNK_SIZE \#define.
 *
 * Each chunk is given an unique ID. Each page also has a unique ID. The
 * relationship between the two IDs is:
 * @code
 *  GMM_CHUNK_SHIFT = log2(GMM_CHUNK_SIZE / GUEST_PAGE_SIZE);
 *  idPage = (idChunk << GMM_CHUNK_SHIFT) | iPage;
 * @endcode
 * Where iPage is the index of the page within the chunk. This ID scheme
 * permits for efficient chunk and page lookup, but it relies on the chunk size
 * to be set at compile time. The chunks are organized in an AVL tree with their
 * IDs being the keys.
 *
 * The physical address of each page in an allocation chunk is maintained by
 * the #RTR0MEMOBJ and obtained using #RTR0MemObjGetPagePhysAddr. There is no
 * need to duplicate this information (it'll cost 8-bytes per page if we did).
 *
 * So what do we need to track per page? Most importantly we need to know
 * which state the page is in:
 *   - Private - Allocated for (eventually) backing one particular VM page.
 *   - Shared  - Readonly page that is used by one or more VMs and treated
 *               as COW by PGM.
 *   - Free    - Not used by anyone.
 *
 * For the page replacement operations (sharing, defragmenting and freeing)
 * to be somewhat efficient, private pages needs to be associated with a
 * particular page in a particular VM.
 *
 * Tracking the usage of shared pages is impractical and expensive, so we'll
 * settle for a reference counting system instead.
 *
 * Free pages will be chained on LIFOs
 *
 * On 64-bit systems we will use a 64-bit bitfield per page, while on 32-bit
 * systems a 32-bit bitfield will have to suffice because of address space
 * limitations. The #GMMPAGE structure shows the details.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_gmm_alloc_strat Page Allocation Strategy
 *
 * The strategy for allocating pages has to take fragmentation and shared
 * pages into account, or we may end up with with 2000 chunks with only
 * a few pages in each. Shared pages cannot easily be reallocated because
 * of the inaccurate usage accounting (see above). Private pages can be
 * reallocated by a defragmentation thread in the same manner that sharing
 * is done.
 *
 * The first approach is to manage the free pages in two sets depending on
 * whether they are mainly for the allocation of shared or private pages.
 * In the initial implementation there will be almost no possibility for
 * mixing shared and private pages in the same chunk (only if we're really
 * stressed on memory), but when we implement forking of VMs and have to
 * deal with lots of COW pages it'll start getting kind of interesting.
 *
 * The sets are lists of chunks with approximately the same number of
 * free pages. Say the chunk size is 1MB, meaning 256 pages, and a set
 * consists of 16 lists. So, the first list will contain the chunks with
 * 1-7 free pages, the second covers 8-15, and so on. The chunks will be
 * moved between the lists as pages are freed up or allocated.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_gmm_costs       Costs
 *
 * The per page cost in kernel space is 32-bit plus whatever RTR0MEMOBJ
 * entails. In addition there is the chunk cost of approximately
 * (sizeof(RT0MEMOBJ) + sizeof(CHUNK)) / 2^CHUNK_SHIFT bytes per page.
 *
 * On Windows the per page #RTR0MEMOBJ cost is 32-bit on 32-bit windows
 * and 64-bit on 64-bit windows (a PFN_NUMBER in the MDL). So, 64-bit per page.
 * The cost on Linux is identical, but here it's because of sizeof(struct page *).
 *
 *
 * @section sec_gmm_legacy      Legacy Mode for Non-Tier-1 Platforms
 *
 * In legacy mode the page source is locked user pages and not
 * #RTR0MemObjAllocPhysNC, this means that a page can only be allocated
 * by the VM that locked it. We will make no attempt at implementing
 * page sharing on these systems, just do enough to make it all work.
 *
 * @note With 6.1 really dropping 32-bit support, the legacy mode is obsoleted
 *       under the assumption that there is sufficient kernel virtual address
 *       space to map all of the guest memory allocations.  So, we'll be using
 *       #RTR0MemObjAllocPage on some platforms as an alternative to
 *       #RTR0MemObjAllocPhysNC.
 *
 *
 * @subsection sub_gmm_locking  Serializing
 *
 * One simple fast mutex will be employed in the initial implementation, not
 * two as mentioned in @ref sec_pgmPhys_Serializing.
 *
 * @see @ref sec_pgmPhys_Serializing
 *
 *
 * @section sec_gmm_overcommit  Memory Over-Commitment Management
 *
 * The GVM will have to do the system wide memory over-commitment
 * management. My current ideas are:
 *      - Per VM oc policy that indicates how much to initially commit
 *        to it and what to do in a out-of-memory situation.
 *      - Prevent overtaxing the host.
 *
 * There are some challenges here, the main ones are configurability and
 * security. Should we for instance permit anyone to request 100% memory
 * commitment? Who should be allowed to do runtime adjustments of the
 * config. And how to prevent these settings from being lost when the last
 * VM process exits? The solution is probably to have an optional root
 * daemon the will keep VMMR0.r0 in memory and enable the security measures.
 *
 *
 *
 * @section sec_gmm_numa        NUMA
 *
 * NUMA considerations will be designed and implemented a bit later.
 *
 * The preliminary guesses is that we will have to try allocate memory as
 * close as possible to the CPUs the VM is executed on (EMT and additional CPU
 * threads). Which means it's mostly about allocation and sharing policies.
 * Both the scheduler and allocator interface will to supply some NUMA info
 * and we'll need to have a way to calc access costs.
