/**
 * Protocol handling and notes:
 *     All client/server components should be backwards compatible.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * Protocol changelog:
 *
 *     Protocol v1 (VBox < 5.0, deprecated):
 *         | Initial implementation which only implemented host to guest transfers.
 *         | For file transfers all file information such as the file name and file size were
 *           transferred with every file data chunk being sent.
 *
 *     Protocol v2 (VBox 5.0 - VBox 5.0.8, deprecated):
 *         + Added support for guest to host transfers.
 *         + Added protocol version support through VBOXDNDCONNECTMSG. The host takes the installed
 *           Guest Additions version as indicator which protocol to use for communicating with the guest.
 *           The guest itself uses VBOXDNDCONNECTMSG to report its supported protocol version to the DnD service.
 *
 *     Protocol v3 (VBox 5.0.10 and up, deprecated):
 *         + Added VBOXDNDDISCONNECTMSG for being able to track client disconnects on host side (Main).
 *         + Added context IDs for every HGCM message. Not used yet and must be 0.
 *         + Added VBOXDNDSNDDATAHDR and VBOXDNDCBSNDDATAHDRDATA to support (simple) accounting of objects
 *           being transferred, along with supplying separate meta data size (which is part of the total size being sent).
 *         + Added new HOST_DND_FN_HG_SND_DATA_HDR + GUEST_DND_FN_GH_SND_DATA_HDR commands which now allow specifying an optional
 *           compression type and defining a checksum for the overall data transfer.
 *         + Enhannced VBOXDNDGHSENDDATAMSG to support (rolling) checksums for the supplied data block.
 *         + VBOXDNDHGSENDDATAMSG and VBOXDNDGHSENDDATAMSG can now contain an optional checksum for the current data block.
 *         | VBOXDNDHGSENDFILEDATAMSG and VBOXDNDGHSENDFILEDATAMSG are now sharing the same HGCM mesasge.
 *         - Removed unused HOST_DND_FN_GH_RECV_DIR, HOST_DND_FN_GH_RECV_FILE_DATA and HOST_DND_FN_GH_RECV_FILE_HDR commands.
 *
 *     VBox 6.1.x and up, current:
 *         + Added GUEST_DND_FN_QUERY_FEATURES + GUEST_DND_FN_REPORT_FEATURES.
 *         - Protocol versioning support in VBOXDNDCONNECTMSG is now marked as being deprecated.
 *
 ** @todo:
 * - Split up messages which use VBOXDNDHGACTIONMSG into own functions and remove parameters which
 *   are not actually needed / used by a function. Why does HOST_DND_FN_HG_EVT_MOVE need all the format stuff, for example?
