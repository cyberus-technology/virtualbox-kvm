# This will be loaded when scm is pointed to any file or directory in the
# VirtualBox source tree.  It will recursively load all .scm-settings files
# it find in or above directories or files it's told to work on.  So,
# .scm-settings files can be placed in sub-directories in the tree to provide
# additional settins specific to that sub-tree.
