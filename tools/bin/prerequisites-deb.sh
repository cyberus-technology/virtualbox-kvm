Usage: `basename ${0}` [--with-docs]

Install the dependencies needed for building VirtualBox on an deb-based Linux
system.  Additional distributions will be added as needed.  There are no plans
to add support for or to accept patches for distributions we do not package.
The \`--with-docs\' parameter is to install the packages needed for building
documentation.  It will also be implemented per distribution as needed."

# To repeat: there are no plans to add support for or to accept patches
# for distributions we do not package.
