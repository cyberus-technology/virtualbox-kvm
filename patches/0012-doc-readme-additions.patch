 ## Known issues and limitations

   * AMD will most likely work too but is considered experimental at the moment.

   VirtualBox KVM.

+## Networking
+
+The new KVM backend utilizes the `--driverless` mode of VirtualBox. Some setups
+that require kernel module support will not work in this mode and prevent the
+VM from starting. Specifically, the Bridged adapter and "NAT Network" modes do
+not work. Only regular NAT is easily supported. More complex setups will need
+manual configuration, e.g., using `tun`/`tap` devices.
+
+## USB pass-through
+
+USB device pass-through is supported. Some `udev` rules are required to
+trigger the creation of fitting device nodes, though. VirtualBox provides the
+`out/linux.amd64/bin/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh` script to create the right nodes.
+Distribution-provided packages of VirtualBox will usually take care of the
+required setup. The following is a short summary of the additional configuration
+steps, which might differ based on the distribution. Be sure to know what you
+are doing when following these steps. This can potentially interfere with
+existing installations.
+
+* Create a group `vboxusers` and add your user to the group. Remember group
+  changes need a re-login or `newgrp` to take effect.
+```shell
+sudo groupadd -r vboxusers -U <username>
+```
+
+* Place the `VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh` script in a system accessible folder
+```shell
+sudo mkdir /usr/lib/virtualbox
+sudo cp out/release/linux.amd64/bin/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh /usr/lib/virtualbox
+sudo chown -R root:vboxusers /usr/lib/virtualbox
+```
+
+* Create a `udev` rule file (e.g. `60-vboxusb.rules`) in `/etc/udev/rules.d/`
+  with the following entries:
+```shell
+SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh $major $minor $attr{bDeviceClass}"
+SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", RUN+="/usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh $major $minor $attr{bDeviceClass}"
