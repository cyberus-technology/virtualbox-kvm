  <title>Change Log</title>

  <para>
    This section summarizes the changes between &product-name; versions.
    Note that this change log is not exhaustive and not all changes are
    listed.
  </para>

  <para>
    &product-name; version numbers consist of three numbers separated by
    dots where the first and second number represent the major version
    and the third number the minor version. Minor version numbers of
    official releases are always even. An odd minor version number
    represents an internal development or test build. In addition, each
    build contains a revision number.
