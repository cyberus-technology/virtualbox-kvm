    As installation of &product-name; varies depending on your host
    operating system, the following sections provide installation
    instructions for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Oracle Solaris.

        Depending on your Windows configuration, you may see warnings
        about unsigned drivers, or similar. Click

        otherwise &product-name; might not function correctly after

        The installer will create an &product-name; group in the Windows

      </para>

      <para>
        With standard settings, &product-name; will be installed for all
        users on the local system. If this is not wanted, you must
        invoke the installer by first extracting as follows:
      </para>

<screen>VirtualBox.exe -extract</screen>

      <para>
        Then, run either of the following commands on the extracted .MSI
        file. This will install &product-name; only for the current
        user.

        If you do not want to install all features of &product-name;,

      <para>
        The user is able to choose between NDIS5 and NDIS6 host network
        filter drivers during the installation. This is done using a
        command line parameter, <literal>NETWORKTYPE</literal>. The
        NDIS6 driver is the default for most supported Windows hosts.
        For some legacy Windows versions, the installer will
        automatically select the NDIS5 driver and this cannot be
        changed.
      </para>

      <para>
        You can force an install of the legacy NDIS5 host network filter
        driver by specifying <literal>NETWORKTYPE=NDIS5</literal>. For
        example, to install the NDIS5 driver on Windows 7 use either of
        the following commands:

<screen>VirtualBox.exe -msiparams NETWORKTYPE=NDIS5</screen>

      <title>The &product-name; Kernel Modules</title>

      <para>
        In order to run other operating systems in virtual machines
        alongside your main operating system, &product-name; needs to
        integrate very tightly with your system. To do this it installs
        a driver module called <command>vboxdrv</command> into the
        system kernel. The kernel is the part of the operating system
        which controls your processor and physical hardware. Without
        this kernel module, you can still use &vbox-mgr; to configure
        virtual machines, but they will not start.
      </para>

      <para>
        Network drivers called <command>vboxnetflt</command> and
        <command>vboxnetadp</command> are also installed. They enable
        virtual machines to make more use of your computer's network
        capabilities and are needed for any virtual machine networking
        beyond the basic NAT mode.
      </para>

      <para>
        Since distributing driver modules separately from the kernel is
        not something which Linux supports well, the &product-name;
        install process creates the modules on the system where they
        will be used. This means that you may need to install some
        software packages from the distribution which are needed for the
        build process. Required packages may include the following:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem>

        </listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
        Also ensure that all system updates have been installed and that
        your system is running the most up-to-date kernel for the
        distribution.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          The running kernel and the kernel header files must be updated
          to matching versions.
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>
        The following list includes some details of the required files
        for some common distributions. Start by finding the version name
        of your kernel, using the command <command>uname -r</command> in
        a terminal. The list assumes that you have not changed too much
        from the original installation, in particular that you have not
        installed a different kernel type.

      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            With Debian and Ubuntu-based distributions, you must install

        installation must be performed as root and from the global
        zone</emphasis>. This is because the &product-name; installer
        loads kernel drivers, which cannot be done from non-global
        zones. To verify which zone you are currently in, execute the
        <command>zonename</command> command.
      </para>

      <para>
        To start installation, run the following commands:
      </para>

<screen>gunzip -cd VirtualBox-<replaceable>version-number</replaceable>-SunOS.tar.gz | tar xvf -</screen>

      <para>
        The &product-name; kernel package is integrated into the main
        package. Install the &product-name; package as follows:
      </para>

<screen>pkgadd -d VirtualBox-<replaceable>version-number</replaceable>-SunOS.pkg</screen>

      <para>
        The installer will then prompt you to enter the package you wish
        to install. Choose <emphasis role="bold">1</emphasis> or
        <emphasis role="bold">all</emphasis> and proceed. Next the
        installer will ask you if you want to allow the postinstall
        script to be executed. Choose <emphasis role="bold">y</emphasis>
        and proceed, as it is essential to execute this script which
        installs the &product-name; kernel module. Following this
        confirmation the installer will install &product-name; and
        execute the postinstall setup script.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once the postinstall script has been executed your installation
        is now complete. You may now safely delete the uncompressed
        package and <filename>autoresponse</filename> files from your
        system. &product-name; is installed in
        <filename>/opt/VirtualBox</filename>.
