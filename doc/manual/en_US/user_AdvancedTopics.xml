      and Oracle Solaris to enable automated logins on the guest.
    </para>

    <para>
      When a guest operating system is running in a virtual machine, it
      might be desirable to perform coordinated and automated logins
      using credentials passed from the host. Credentials are user name,
      password, and domain name, where each value might be empty.

      <title>Automated Windows Guest Logins</title>

      <para>
        Windows provides a modular system login subsystem, called
        Winlogon, which can be customized and extended by means of
        so-called GINA (Graphical Identification and Authentication)
        modules. In Windows Vista and later releases, the GINA modules
        were replaced with a new mechanism called credential providers.
        The &product-name; Guest Additions for Windows come with both, a
        GINA and a credential provider module, and therefore enable any
        Windows guest to perform automated logins.
      </para>

      <para>
        To activate the &product-name; GINA or credential provider
        module, install the Guest Additions using the command line
        switch <option>/with_autologon</option>. All the following
        manual steps required for installing these modules will be then
        done by the installer.
      </para>

      <para>
        To manually install the &product-name; GINA module, extract the
        Guest Additions as shown in
        <xref linkend="windows-guest-file-extraction" />, and copy the
        <filename>VBoxGINA.dll</filename> file to the Windows
        <filename>SYSTEM32</filename> directory. In the registry, create
        the following key with a value of
        <filename>VBoxGINA.dll</filename>:
      </para>

<screen>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GinaDLL</screen>

      <note>
        <para>
          The &product-name; GINA module is implemented as a wrapper
          around the <filename>MSGINA.DLL</filename> standard Windows
          GINA module. As a result, it might not work correctly with
          third-party GINA modules.
        </para>

      <para>
        To manually install the &product-name; credential provider
        module, extract the Guest Additions as shown in

        <filename>VBoxCredProv.dll</filename> file to the Windows
        <filename>SYSTEM32</filename> directory. In the registry, create

        Create the following string and assign it a value of
        <literal>Apartment</literal>.

      <para>
        To set credentials, use the following command on a
        <emphasis>running</emphasis> VM:
      </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage controlvm "Windows XP" setcredentials "John Doe" "secretpassword" "DOMTEST"</screen>

      <para>
        While the VM is running, the credentials can be queried by the
        &product-name; login modules, GINA or credential provider, using
        the &product-name; Guest Additions device driver. When Windows
        is in <emphasis>logged out</emphasis> mode, the login modules
        will constantly poll for credentials and if they are present, a
        login will be attempted. After retrieving the credentials, the
        login modules will erase them so that the above command will
        have to be repeated for subsequent logins.
      </para>

      <para>
        For security reasons, credentials are not stored in any
        persistent manner and will be lost when the VM is reset. Also,
        the credentials are write-only. There is no way to retrieve the
        credentials from the host side. Credentials can be reset from
        the host side by setting empty values.

      <para>
        &product-name; provides a custom PAM module (Pluggable
        Authentication Module) which can be used to perform automated
        guest logins on platforms which support this framework.
        Virtually all modern Linux and UNIX distributions rely on PAM.
      </para>

      <para>
        For automated logins on Ubuntu, or Ubuntu-derived, distributions
        using LightDM as the display manager. See

      <para>
        The <filename>pam_vbox.so</filename> module itself
        <emphasis>does not</emphasis> do an actual verification of the
        credentials passed to the guest OS. Instead it relies on other
        modules such as <filename>pam_unix.so</filename> or
        <filename>pam_unix2.so</filename> down in the PAM stack to do
        the actual validation using the credentials retrieved by
        <filename>pam_vbox.so</filename>. Therefore
        <filename>pam_vbox.so</filename> has to be on top of the

      <note>
        <para>
          The <filename>pam_vbox.so</filename> module only supports the

        copied from
        <filename>/opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-<replaceable>version</replaceable>/other/</filename>
        to the security modules directory. This is usually
        <filename>/lib/security/</filename> on 32-bit Linux guests or

      <para>
        For graphics integration to work correctly, the X server must
        load the <literal>vboxvideo</literal> driver. Many recent X
        server versions look for it automatically if they see that they
        are running in &product-name;. For an optimal user experience,
        the guest kernel drivers must be loaded and the Guest Additions
        tool <command>VBoxClient</command> must be running as a client
        in the X session.
      </para>

      <para>
        For mouse integration to work correctly, the guest kernel
        drivers must be loaded. In addition, for legacy X servers the
        correct <literal>vboxmouse</literal> driver must be loaded and
        associated with <filename>/dev/mouse</filename> or

      With virtual machines running modern server operating systems,
      &product-name; supports CPU hot-plugging.
    </para>

    <para>
      On a physical computer CPU hot-plugging would mean that a CPU can
      be added or removed while the machine is running. &product-name;
      supports adding and removing of virtual CPUs while a virtual
      machine is running.
    </para>

    <para>
      CPU hot-plugging works only with guest operating systems that
      support the feature. So far this applies only to Linux and Windows
      Server. Windows supports only hot-add, while Linux supports
      hot-add and hot-remove. To use this feature with more than 8 CPUs,
      a 64-bit Linux guest is required.
    </para>

    <para>
      CPU hot-plugging is done using the <command>VBoxManage</command>
      command-line interface. First, hot-plugging needs to be enabled
      for a virtual machine:
    </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage modifyvm <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> --cpu-hotplug on</screen>

    <para>
      The <option>--cpus</option> option is used to specify the maximum
      number of CPUs that the virtual machine can have:
    </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage modifyvm <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> --cpus 8</screen>

    <para>
      When the VM is off, you can then add and remove virtual CPUs with
      the <command>VBoxManage modifyvm --plug-cpu</command> and
      <command>VBoxManage modifyvm --unplug-cpu</command> commands,
      which take the number of the virtual CPU as a parameter, as
      follows:
    </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage modifyvm <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> --plug-cpu 3
$ VBoxManage modifyvm <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> --unplug-cpu 3</screen>

    <para>
      Note that CPU 0 can never be removed.
    </para>

    <para>
      While the VM is running, CPUs can be added and removed with the
      <command>VBoxManage controlvm plugcpu</command> and
      <command>VBoxManage controlvm unplugcpu</command> commands
      instead, as follows:
    </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage controlvm <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> plugcpu 3

    <para>
      To prevent ejection while the CPU is still used it has to be
      ejected from within the guest before. The Linux Guest Additions
      contain a service which receives hot-remove events and ejects the
      CPU. Also, after a CPU is added to the VM it is not automatically
      used by Linux. The Linux Guest Additions service will take care of
      that if installed. If not a CPU can be started with the following

      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      This feature enables a guest to directly use physical PCI devices
      on the host, even if host does not have drivers for this
      particular device. Both, regular PCI and some PCI Express cards,
      are supported. AGP and certain PCI Express cards are not supported
      at the moment if they rely on Graphics Address Remapping Table
      (GART) unit programming for texture management as it does rather
      non-trivial operations with pages remapping interfering with
      IOMMU. This limitation may be lifted in future releases.
    </para>

    <para>
      To be fully functional, PCI passthrough support in &product-name;
      depends upon an IOMMU hardware unit. If the device uses bus
      mastering, for example it performs DMA to the OS memory on its
      own, then an IOMMU is required. Otherwise such DMA transactions
      may write to the wrong physical memory address as the device DMA
      engine is programmed using a device-specific protocol to perform
      memory transactions. The IOMMU functions as translation unit
      mapping physical memory access requests from the device using
      knowledge of the guest physical address to host physical addresses
      translation rules.
    </para>

    <para>
      Intel's solution for IOMMU is called Intel Virtualization
      Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d), and AMD's solution is called
      AMD-Vi. Check your motherboard datasheet for the appropriate
      technology. Even if your hardware does not have a IOMMU, certain
      PCI cards may work, such as serial PCI adapters, but the guest
      will show a warning on boot and the VM execution will terminate if
      the guest driver will attempt to enable card bus mastering.
    </para>

    <para>
      It is very common that the BIOS or the host OS disables the IOMMU
      by default. So before any attempt to use it please make sure that
      the following apply:

        &product-name; includes a feature called <emphasis>webcam
        passthrough</emphasis>, which enables a guest to use a host
        webcam. This complements the general USB passthrough support
        which was the typical way of using host webcams in legacy
        releases. The webcam passthrough support can handle non-USB
        video sources in theory, but this is completely untested.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          The webcam passthrough module is shipped as part of the
          &product-name; extension pack, which must be installed
          separately. See <xref linkend="intro-installing" />.

      <para>
        The host webcam can be attached to the VM using the
        <emphasis role="bold">Devices</emphasis> menu in the VM menu
        bar. The <emphasis role="bold">Webcams</emphasis> menu contains
        a list of available video input devices on the host. Clicking on
        a webcam name attaches or detaches the corresponding host
        device.

      <para>
        The <command>VBoxManage</command> command line tool can be used
        to enable webcam passthrough. Please see the host-specific

      <title>Using a Raw Host Hard Disk From a Guest</title>

      <para>
        As an alternative to using virtual disk images as described in
        <xref linkend="storage" />, &product-name; can also present
        either entire physical hard disks or selected partitions as
        virtual disks to virtual machines.
      </para>

      <para>
        With &product-name;, this type of access is called <emphasis>raw
        hard disk access</emphasis>. It enables a guest operating system
        to access its virtual hard disk without going through the host
        OS file system. The actual performance difference for image
        files compared to raw disk varies greatly depending on the
        overhead of the host file system, whether dynamically growing
        images are used, and on host OS caching strategies. The caching
        indirectly also affects other aspects such as failure behavior.
        For example, whether the virtual disk contains all data written
        before a host OS crash. Consult your host OS documentation for
        details on this.
      </para>

      <warning>
        <para>
          Raw hard disk access is for expert users only. Incorrect use
          or use of an outdated configuration can lead to
          <emphasis role="bold">total loss of data</emphasis> on the
          physical disk. Most importantly, <emphasis>do not</emphasis>
          attempt to boot the partition with the currently running host
          operating system in a guest. This will lead to severe data
          corruption.
        </para>
      </warning>

      <para>
        Raw hard disk access, both for entire disks and individual
        partitions, is implemented as part of the VMDK image format
        support. As a result, you will need to create a special VMDK
        image file which defines where the data will be stored. After
        creating such a special VMDK image, you can use it like a
        regular virtual disk image. For example, you can use the Virtual
        Media Manager, see <xref linkend="virtual-media-manager" />, or
        <command>VBoxManage</command> to assign the image to a virtual
        machine.

        <para>
          While this variant is the simplest to set up, you must be
          aware that this will give a guest operating system direct and
          full access to an <emphasis>entire physical disk</emphasis>.
          If your <emphasis>host</emphasis> operating system is also
          booted from this disk, please take special care to not access
          the partition from the guest at all. On the positive side, the
          physical disk can be repartitioned in arbitrary ways without
          having to recreate the image file that gives access to the raw
          disk.
        </para>

        <para>
          On a Linux host, to create an image that represents an entire
          physical hard disk which will not contain any actual data, as
          this will all be stored on the physical disk, use the
          following command:
        </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage createmedium disk --filename <replaceable>path-to-file</replaceable>.vmdk --format=VMDK
 --variant RawDisk --property RawDrive=/dev/sda</screen>

        <para>
          This creates the
          <filename><replaceable>path-to-file</replaceable>.vmdk</filename>
          file image that must be an absolute path. All data is read and
          written from <filename>/dev/sda</filename>.
        </para>

        <para>
          On a Windows host, instead of the above device specification,
          for example use <filename>\\.\PhysicalDrive0</filename>. On a
          macOS host, instead of the above device specification use for
          example <filename>/dev/rdisk1</filename>. Note that on Mac OS
          X you can only get access to an entire disk if no volume is
          mounted from it.
        </para>

        <para>
          Creating the image requires read/write access for the given
          device. Read/write access is also later needed when using the
          image from a virtual machine. On some host platforms, such as
          Windows, raw disk access may be restricted and not permitted
          by the host OS in some situations.
        </para>

        <para>
          Just like with regular disk images, this does not
          automatically attach the newly created image to a virtual

<screen>$ VBoxManage storageattach WindowsXP --storagectl "IDE Controller" \
 --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium <replaceable>path-to-file</replaceable>.vmdk</screen>

          When this is done the selected virtual machine will boot from
          the specified physical disk.

        <title>Access to Individual Physical Hard Disk Partitions</title>

        <para>
          This <emphasis>raw partition support</emphasis> is quite
          similar to the full hard disk access described above. However,
          in this case, any partitioning information will be stored
          inside the VMDK image. This means that you can install a
          different boot loader in the virtual hard disk without
          affecting the host's partitioning information. While the guest
          will be able to <emphasis>see</emphasis> all partitions that
          exist on the physical disk, access will be filtered in that
          reading from partitions for which no access is allowed the
          partitions will only yield zeroes, and all writes to them are
          ignored.
        </para>

        <para>
          To create a special image for raw partition support, which
          will contain a small amount of data, on a Linux host, use the
          command:
        </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage createmedium disk --filename <replaceable>path-to-file</replaceable>.vmdk --format=VMDK
--variant RawDisk --property RawDrive=/dev/sda --property Partitions=1,5</screen>

        <para>
          The command is identical to the one for full hard disk access,
          except for the additional <option>--property
          Partitions=1,5</option> parameter. This example would create
          the image
          <filename><replaceable>path-to-file</replaceable>.vmdk</filename>,
          which must be absolute, and partitions 1 and 5 of
          <filename>/dev/sda</filename> would be made accessible to the
          guest.
        </para>

        <para>
          &product-name; uses the same partition numbering as your Linux
          host. As a result, the numbers given in the above example
          would refer to the first primary partition and the first
          logical drive in the extended partition, respectively.
        </para>

        <para>
          On a Windows host, instead of the above device specification,
          use for example <filename>\\.\PhysicalDrive0</filename>. On a
          macOS host, instead of the above device specification use
          <filename>/dev/rdisk1</filename>, for example. Note that on OS
          X you can only use partitions which are not mounted. Unmount
          the respective disk first using <emphasis>diskutil unmountDisk
          <filename>/dev/diskX</filename></emphasis>. Partition numbers
          are the same on Linux, Windows, and macOS hosts.
        </para>

        <para>
          The numbers for the list of partitions can be taken from the
          output of the following command:
        </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage list hostdrives</screen>

        <para>
          The output lists available drives and their partitions with
          the partition types and sizes to give the user enough
          information to identify the partitions necessary for the
          guest.
        </para>

        <para>
          Images which give access to individual partitions are specific
          to a particular host disk setup. You cannot transfer these
          images to another host. Also, whenever the host partitioning
          changes, the image <emphasis>must be recreated</emphasis>.
        </para>

        <para>
          Creating the image requires read/write access for the given
          device. Read/write access is also later needed when using the
          image from a virtual machine. If this is not feasible, there
          is a special variant for raw partition access, currently only
          available on Linux hosts, that avoids having to give the
          current user access to the entire disk. To set up such an
          image, use:
        </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage createmedium disk --filename <replaceable>path-to-file</replaceable>.vmdk --format=VMDK
--variant RawDisk --property RawDrive=/dev/sda --property Partitions=1,5
--property Relative=1</screen>

        <para>
          When used from a virtual machine, the image will then refer
          not to the entire disk, but only to the individual partitions.
          In this example, <filename>/dev/sda1</filename> and
          <filename>/dev/sda5</filename>. As a consequence, read/write
          access is only required for the affected partitions, not for
          the entire disk. During creation however, read-only access to
          the entire disk is required to obtain the partitioning
          information.
        </para>

        <para>
          In some configurations it may be necessary to change the MBR
          code of the created image. For example, to replace the Linux
          boot loader that is used on the host by another boot loader.
          This enables for example the guest to boot directly to
          Windows, while the host boots Linux from the "same" disk. For
          this purpose the <option>--property-file
          BootSector=<replaceable>path-to-file-with-boot-sector</replaceable></option>
          parameter is provided. It specifies a file name from which to
          take the MBR code. The partition table is not modified at all,
          so a MBR file from a system with totally different
          partitioning can be used. An example of this is:
        </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage createmedium disk --filename <replaceable>path-to-file</replaceable>.vmdk --format=VMDK
--variant RawDisk --property RawDrive=/dev/sda --property Partitions=1,5
--property-file BootSector=winxp.mbr</screen>

        <para>
          The modified MBR will be stored inside the image, not on the
          host disk.
        </para>

        <para>
          The created image can be attached to a storage controller in a
          VM configuration as usual.

      <title>Configuring the Guest Time Stamp Counter (TSC) to Reflect Guest
        Execution</title>

      <para>
        By default, &product-name; keeps all sources of time visible to
        the guest synchronized to a single time source, the monotonic
        host time. This reflects the assumptions of many guest operating
        systems, which expect all time sources to reflect "wall clock"
        time. In special circumstances it may be useful however to make
        the time stamp counter (TSC) in the guest reflect the time
        actually spent executing the guest.
      </para>

      <para>
        This special TSC handling mode can be enabled on a per-VM basis,
        and for best results must be used only in combination with
        hardware virtualization. To enable this mode use the following
        command:
      </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage setextradata <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> "VBoxInternal/TM/TSCTiedToExecution" 1</screen>

      <para>
        To revert to the default TSC handling mode use:
      </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage setextradata <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> "VBoxInternal/TM/TSCTiedToExecution"</screen>

      <para>
        Note that if you use the special TSC handling mode with a guest
        operating system which is very strict about the consistency of
        time sources you may get a warning or error message about the
        timing inconsistency. It may also cause clocks to become
        unreliable with some guest operating systems depending on how
        they use the TSC.

      <title>Accelerate or Slow Down the Guest Clock</title>

      <para>
        For certain purposes it can be useful to accelerate or to slow

      </para>

<screen>$ VBoxManage setextradata <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> "VBoxInternal/TM/WarpDrivePercentage" 200</screen>

<screen>$ VBoxManage setextradata <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> "VBoxInternal/TM/WarpDrivePercentage" 50</screen>

      <para>
        will halve the speed of the guest clock. Note that changing the
        rate of the virtual clock can confuse the guest and can even
        lead to abnormal guest behavior. For instance, a higher clock
        rate means shorter timeouts for virtual devices with the result
        that a slightly increased response time of a virtual device due
        to an increased host load can cause guest failures. Note further
        that any time synchronization mechanism will frequently try to
        resynchronize the guest clock with the reference clock, which is
        the host clock if the &product-name; Guest Additions are active.
        Therefore any time synchronization should be disabled if the
        rate of the guest clock is changed as described above. See

        By default, the mouse is captured if the user clicks on the
        guest window and the guest expects relative mouse coordinates at
        this time. This happens if the pointing device is configured as
        PS/2 mouse and the guest has not yet started the &product-name;
        Guest Additions. For instance, the guest is booting or the Guest
        Additions are not installed, or if the pointing device is
        configured as a USB tablet but the guest has no USB driver
        loaded yet. Once the Guest Additions become active or the USB
        guest driver is started, the mouse capture is automatically
        released.

          This service automatically takes care of a VM's configured
          memory balloon. See <xref linkend="guestadd-balloon" />. This
          service is useful for server environments where VMs may
          dynamically require more or less memory during runtime.
        </para>

        <para>
          The service periodically checks a VM's current memory balloon
          and its free guest RAM and automatically adjusts the current
          memory balloon by inflating or deflating it accordingly. This
          handling only applies to running VMs having recent Guest
          Additions installed.

      All configuration values can be either specified using the command
      line or global extradata, whereas command line values always have
      a higher priority when set. Some of the configuration values also

      command line, per-VM basis extradata if available, global
      extradata.

      <title>Host Isolation Detection</title>

      <para>
        To detect whether a host is being isolated, that is, the host
        cannot reach the &product-name; server instance anymore, the
        host needs to set an alternating value to a global extradata
        value within a time period. If this value is not set within that
        time period a timeout occurred and the so-called host isolation
        response will be performed to the VMs handled. Which VMs are
        handled can be controlled by defining VM groups and assigning
        VMs to those groups. By default no groups are set, meaning that
        all VMs on the server will be handled when no host response is
        received within 30 seconds.

      Another extension pack called VNC is available. This extension
      pack is open source and replaces the previous integration of the

      initially available in the &product-name; source code package
      only. It is to a large portion code contributed by users, and is

      The keyboard handling is severely limited, and only the US

      differences to the US keyboard layout it is most likely unusable.

    <para>
      It is possible to install both the &product-name; Extension Pack
      and VNC, but only one VRDE module can be active at any time. The

    </para>

<screen>VBoxManage setproperty vrdeextpack VNC</screen>

    <para>
      Configuring the remote access works very similarly to VRDP, see
      <xref linkend="vrde" />, with some limitations. VNC does not
      support specifying several port numbers, and the authentication is
      done differently. VNC can only deal with password authentication,
      and there is no option to use password hashes. This leaves no
      other choice than having a clear-text password in the VM
      configuration, which can be set with the following command:
    </para>

<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> --vrde-property VNCPassword=secret</screen>

    <para>
      The user is responsible for keeping this password secret, and it
      should be removed when a VM configuration is passed to another
      person, for whatever purpose. Some VNC servers claim to have
      encrypted passwords in the configuration. This is not true
      encryption, it is only concealing the passwords, which is only as
      secure as using clear-text passwords.

        Encrypting disk images can be done either using &vbox-mgr; or
        the <command>VBoxManage</command>. While &vbox-mgr; is easier to
        use, it works on a per VM basis and encrypts all disk images
        attached to the specific VM. With <command>VBoxManage</command>
        one can encrypt individual images, including all differencing
        images. To encrypt an unencrypted medium with
        <command>VBoxManage</command>, use:
      </para>

<screen>VBoxManage encryptmedium <replaceable>uuid</replaceable>|<replaceable>filename</replaceable> \
--newpassword <replaceable>filename</replaceable>|- --cipher <replaceable>cipher-ID</replaceable> --newpasswordid "<replaceable>ID</replaceable></screen>

      <para>
        To supply the encryption password point
        <command>VBoxManage</command> to the file where the password is
        stored or specify <option>-</option> to let VBoxManage ask you
        for the password on the command line.
      </para>

      <para>
        The cipher parameter specifies the cipher to use for encryption
        and can be either <literal>AES-XTS128-PLAIN64</literal> or
        <literal>AES-XTS256-PLAIN64</literal>. The specified password
        identifier can be freely chosen by the user and is used for
        correct identification when supplying multiple passwords during
        VM startup.
      </para>

      <para>
        If the user uses the same password when encrypting multiple
        images and also the same password identifier, the user needs to
        supply the password only once during VM startup.

      <title>Starting a VM with Encrypted Images</title>

      <para>
        When a VM is started using &vbox-mgr;, a dialog will open where
        the user needs to enter all passwords for all encrypted images
        attached to the VM. If another frontend like VBoxHeadless is
        used, the VM will be paused as soon as the guest tries to access
        an encrypted disk. The user needs to provide the passwords
        through <command>VBoxManage</command> using the following
        command:
      </para>

<screen>VBoxManage controlvm <replaceable>uuid</replaceable>|<replaceable>vmname</replaceable> addencpassword <replaceable>ID</replaceable> <replaceable>password</replaceable> [--removeonsuspend yes|no]</screen>

      <para>
        <replaceable>ID</replaceable> must be the same as the password
        identifier supplied when encrypting the images.
        <replaceable>password</replaceable> is the password used when
        encrypting the images. Optionally, you can specify
        <option>--removeonsuspend yes|no</option> to specify whether to
        remove the password from VM memory when the VM is suspended.
        Before the VM can be resumed, the user needs to supply the
        passwords again. This is useful when a VM is suspended by a host
        suspend event and the user does not want the password to remain
        in memory.

        VM or using <command>VBoxManage</command> with the following
        command:

    <para>
      To enable PC speaker passthrough use the following command:
    </para>

<screen>VBoxManage setextradata <replaceable>VM-name</replaceable> "VBoxInternal/Devices/i8254/0/Config/PassthroughSpeaker" <replaceable>N</replaceable></screen>

    <para>
      Replace <replaceable>N</replaceable> with the code representing
      the case you want to use. Changing this setting takes effect when
      you next start the VM. It is safe to enable PC speaker passthrough
      on all host OSes. It will only have an effect on Linux.
    </para>

    <para>
      The VM log file, <filename>VBox.log</filename>, contains lines
      with the prefix <literal>PIT: speaker:</literal> showing the PC
      speaker passthrough setup activities. It gives hints which device
      it picked or why it failed.
    </para>

    <para>
      Enabling PC speaker passthrough for the VM is usually the simple
      part. The real difficulty is making sure that &product-name; can
      access the necessary device, because in a typical Linux install
      most of them can only be accessed by user <literal>root</literal>.
      You should follow the preferred way to persistently change this,
      such as by referring to your distribution's documentation. Since
      there are countless Linux distribution variants, we can only give
      the general hints that there is often a way to give the X11
      session user access to additional devices, or you need to find a
      working solution using a udev configuration file. If everything
      fails you might try setting the permissions using a script which
      is run late enough in the host system startup.
    </para>

    <para>
      Sometimes additional rules are applied by the kernel to limit
      access. For example, that the VM process must have the same
      controlling terminal as the device configured to be used for
      beeping, something which is often very difficult to achieve for
      GUI applications such as &product-name;. The table above contains
      some hints, but in general refer to the Linux documentation.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you have trouble getting any beeps even if the device
      permissions are set up and VBox.log confirms that it uses evdev or
      console for the PC speaker control, check if your system has a PC
      speaker. Some systems do not have one. Other complications can
      arise from Linux rerouting the PC speaker output to a sound card.
      Check if the beeps are audible if you connect speakers to your
      sound card. Today almost all systems have one. Finally, check if
      the audio mixer control has a channel named "beep", which could be
      hidden in the mixer settings, and that it is not muted.

    <title>Accessing USB devices Exposed Over the Network with USB/IP</title>

    <para>
      &product-name; supports passing through USB devices which are
      exposed over the network using the USB over IP protocol without
      the need to configure the client side provided by the kernel and
      usbip tools. Furthermore, this feature works with &product-name;
      running on any supported host, rather than just Linux alone, as is
      the case with the official client.
    </para>

    <para>
      To enable support for passing through USB/IP devices, use the
      following command to add the device server that exports the
      devices:
    </para>

<screen>VBoxManage usbdevsource add <replaceable>unique-name</replaceable> --backend <replaceable>USBIP</replaceable> --address <replaceable>device-server</replaceable>[:<replaceable>port</replaceable>]</screen>

    <para>
      USB devices exported on the device server are then accessible
      through &vbox-mgr; or <command>VBoxManage</command>, like any USB
      devices attached locally. This can be used multiple times to
      access different device servers.
    </para>

    <para>
      To remove a device server, the following command can be used:

      <title>Setting up USB/IP Support on a Linux System</title>

      <para>
        This section gives a brief overview on how to set up a Linux
        based system to act as a USB device server. The system on the
        server requires that the <filename>usbip-core.ko</filename> and
        <filename>usbip-host.ko</filename> kernel drivers are available,
        and that the USB/IP tools package is installed. The particular
        installation method for the necessary tools depends on which
        distribution is used. For example, for Debian based systems, use
        the following command to install the required tools:
      </para>

<screen>$ apt-get install usbip-utils</screen>

      <para>
        To check whether the necessary tools are already installed use
        the following command:
      </para>

<screen>
$ usbip list -l
      </screen>

      <para>
        This should produce output similar to that shown in the example
        below:
      </para>

<screen>
 - busid 4-2 (0bda:0301)
   Realtek Semiconductor Corp. : multicard reader (0bda:0301)

   Logitech, Inc. : Unifying Receiver (046d:c52b)
      </screen>

      <para>
        If everything is installed, the USB/IP server needs to be
        started as <literal>root</literal> using the following command:
      </para>

<screen># usbipd -D</screen>

      <para>
        See the documentation for the installed distribution to
        determine how to start the service when the system boots.
      </para>

      <para>
        By default, no device on the server is exported. This must be
        done manually for each device. To export a device use the
        following command:
      </para>

<screen># usbip bind -b "bus identifier"</screen>

      <para>
        To export the multicard reader in the previous example:

      <title>Security Considerations</title>

      <para>
        The communication between the server and client is unencrypted
        and there is no authorization required to access exported
        devices. An attacker might sniff sensitive data or gain control
        over a device. To mitigate this risk, the device should be
        exposed over a local network to which only trusted clients have
        access. To access the device remotely over a public network, a
        VPN solution should be used to provide the required level of
        security protection.
