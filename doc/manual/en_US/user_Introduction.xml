  <para>
    Welcome to &product-name;.
  </para>

  <para>
    &product-name; is a cross-platform virtualization application. What
    does that mean? For one thing, it installs on your existing Intel or
    AMD-based computers, whether they are running Windows, macOS, Linux,
    or Oracle Solaris operating systems (OSes). Secondly, it extends the
    capabilities of your existing computer so that it can run multiple
    OSes, inside multiple virtual machines, at the same time. As an
    example, you can run Windows and Linux on your Mac, run Windows
    Server on your Linux server, run Linux on your Windows PC, and so
    on, all alongside your existing applications. You can install and
    run as many virtual machines as you like. The only practical limits
    are disk space and memory.
  </para>

  <para>
    &product-name; is deceptively simple yet also very powerful. It can
    run everywhere from small embedded systems or desktop class machines
    all the way up to datacenter deployments and even Cloud
    environments.
  </para>

  <para>
    The following screenshot shows how &product-name;, installed on an
    Apple Mac computer, is running Windows Server 2016 in a virtual
    machine window.

    In this User Manual, we will begin simply with a quick introduction
    to virtualization and how to get your first virtual machine running
    with the easy-to-use &product-name; graphical user interface.
    Subsequent chapters will go into much more detail covering more
    powerful tools and features, but fortunately, it is not necessary to
    read the entire User Manual before you can use &product-name;.

    You can find a summary of &product-name;'s capabilities in
    <xref linkend="features-overview" />. For existing &product-name;
    users who just want to find out what is new in this release, see the

    <title>Why is Virtualization Useful?</title>

    <para>
      The techniques and features that &product-name; provides are
      useful in the following scenarios:

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Running multiple operating systems
          simultaneously.</emphasis> &product-name; enables you to run
          more than one OS at a time. This way, you can run software
          written for one OS on another, such as Windows software on
          Linux or a Mac, without having to reboot to use it. Since you
          can configure what kinds of <emphasis>virtual</emphasis>
          hardware should be presented to each such OS, you can install
          an old OS such as DOS or OS/2 even if your real computer's
          hardware is no longer supported by that OS.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Easier software
          installations.</emphasis> Software vendors can use virtual
          machines to ship entire software configurations. For example,
          installing a complete mail server solution on a real machine
          can be a tedious task. With &product-name;, such a complex
          setup, often called an <emphasis>appliance</emphasis>, can be
          packed into a virtual machine. Installing and running a mail
          server becomes as easy as importing such an appliance into
          &product-name;.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Testing and disaster
          recovery.</emphasis> Once installed, a virtual machine and its
          virtual hard disks can be considered a

          woken up, copied, backed up, and transported between hosts.
        </para>

        <para>
          Using virtual machines enables you to build and test a
          multi-node networked service, for example. Issues with
          networking, operating system, and software configuration can
          be investigated easily.

        <para>
          In addition to that, with the use of another &product-name;
          feature called <emphasis>snapshots</emphasis>, one can save a
          particular state of a virtual machine and revert back to that
          state, if necessary. This way, one can freely experiment with
          a computing environment. If something goes wrong, such as
          problems after installing software or infecting the guest with
          a virus, you can easily switch back to a previous snapshot and
          avoid the need of frequent backups and restores.
        </para>

        <para>
          Any number of snapshots can be created, allowing you to travel
          back and forward in virtual machine time. You can delete
          snapshots while a VM is running to reclaim disk space.

          <emphasis role="bold">Infrastructure consolidation.</emphasis>
          Virtualization can significantly reduce hardware and
          electricity costs. Most of the time, computers today only use
          a fraction of their potential power and run with low average
          system loads. A lot of hardware resources as well as
          electricity is thereby wasted. So, instead of running many
          such physical computers that are only partially used, one can
          pack many virtual machines onto a few powerful hosts and
          balance the loads between them.

  <sect1 id="virtintro">

    <title>Some Terminology</title>

    <para>
      When dealing with virtualization, and also for understanding the
      following chapters of this documentation, it helps to acquaint
      oneself with a bit of crucial terminology, especially the
      following terms:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Host operating system (host
          OS).</emphasis> This is the OS of the physical computer on
          which &product-name; was installed. There are versions of
          &product-name; for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Oracle Solaris
          hosts. See <xref linkend="hostossupport" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          Most of the time, this manual discusses all &product-name;
          versions together. There may be platform-specific differences
          which we will point out where appropriate.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Guest operating system (guest
          OS).</emphasis> This is the OS that is running inside the
          virtual machine. Theoretically, &product-name; can run any x86
          OS such as DOS, Windows, OS/2, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. But to
          achieve near-native performance of the guest code on your
          machine, we had to go through a lot of optimizations that are
          specific to certain OSes. So while your favorite OS
          <emphasis>may</emphasis> run as a guest, we officially support
          and optimize for a select few, which include the most common
          OSes.
        </para>

        <para>
          See <xref linkend="guestossupport" />.

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Virtual machine (VM).</emphasis> This is
          the special environment that &product-name; creates for your
          guest OS while it is running. In other words, you run your
          guest OS <emphasis>in</emphasis> a VM. Normally, a VM is shown
          as a window on your computer's desktop. Depending on which of
          the various frontends of &product-name; you use, the VM might
          be shown in full screen mode or remotely on another computer.
        </para>

        <para>
          Internally, &product-name; treats a VM as a set of parameters
          that specify its behavior. Some parameters describe hardware
          settings, such as the amount of memory and number of CPUs
          assigned. Other parameters describe the state information,
          such as whether the VM is running or saved.
        </para>

        <para>
          You can view these VM settings in &vbox-mgr;, in the
          <emphasis role="bold">Settings</emphasis> window, and by
          running the <command>VBoxManage</command> command. See
          <xref linkend="vboxmanage" />.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Guest Additions.</emphasis> This refers
          to special software packages which are shipped with
          &product-name; but designed to be installed
          <emphasis>inside</emphasis> a VM to improve performance of the
          guest OS and to add extra features. See

    <title>Features Overview</title>

    <para>
      The following is a brief outline of &product-name;'s main
      features:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Portability.</emphasis> &product-name;
          runs on a large number of 64-bit host operating systems. See
          <xref linkend="hostossupport" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          &product-name; is a so-called <emphasis>hosted</emphasis>
          hypervisor, sometimes referred to as a <emphasis>type
          2</emphasis> hypervisor. Whereas a
          <emphasis>bare-metal</emphasis> or <emphasis>type 1</emphasis>
          hypervisor runs directly on the hardware, &product-name;
          requires an existing OS to be installed. It can thus run
          alongside existing applications on that host.
        </para>

        <para>
          To a very large degree, &product-name; is functionally
          identical on all of the host platforms, and the same file and
          image formats are used. This enables you to run virtual
          machines created on one host on another host with a different
          host OS. For example, you can create a virtual machine on
          Windows and then run it on Linux.
        </para>

        <para>
          In addition, virtual machines can easily be imported and
          exported using the Open Virtualization Format (OVF), an
          industry standard created for this purpose. You can even
          import OVFs that were created with a different virtualization
          software. See <xref linkend="ovf" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          For users of &oci; the functionality extends to exporting and
          importing virtual machines to and from the cloud. This
          simplifies development of applications and deployment to the
          production environment. See
          <xref linkend="cloud-export-oci"/>.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Guest Additions: shared folders,
          seamless windows, 3D virtualization.</emphasis> The
          &product-name; Guest Additions are software packages which can
          be installed <emphasis>inside</emphasis> of supported guest
          systems to improve their performance and to provide additional
          integration and communication with the host system. After
          installing the Guest Additions, a virtual machine will support
          automatic adjustment of video resolutions, seamless windows,
          accelerated 3D graphics and more. See
          <xref linkend="guestadditions" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          In particular, Guest Additions provide for <emphasis>shared
          folders</emphasis>, which let you access files on the host
          system from within a guest machine. See
          <xref linkend="sharedfolders" />.

              &product-name; implements a virtual USB controller and
              enables you to connect arbitrary USB devices to your
              virtual machines without having to install device-specific
              drivers on the host. USB support is not limited to certain
              device categories. See <xref linkend="settings-usb" />.

              &product-name; virtualizes a vast array of virtual
              devices, among them many devices that are typically
              provided by other virtualization platforms. That includes
              IDE, SCSI, and SATA hard disk controllers, several virtual
              network cards and sound cards, virtual serial and parallel
              ports and an Input/Output Advanced Programmable Interrupt
              Controller (I/O APIC), which is found in many computer
              systems. This enables easy cloning of disk images from
              real machines and importing of third-party virtual
              machines into &product-name;.

              <emphasis>ACPI power status support</emphasis>,
              &product-name; can even report to ACPI-aware guest OSes
              the power status of the host. For mobile systems running
              on battery, the guest can thus enable energy saving and
              notify the user of the remaining power, for example in
              full screen modes.

              machine directly to an iSCSI storage server without going
              through the host system. The VM accesses the iSCSI target
              directly without the extra overhead that is required for

          in time and revert the virtual machine to any such snapshot
          and start an alternative VM configuration from there,
          effectively creating a whole snapshot tree. See

          provides a groups feature that enables the user to organize
          and control virtual machines collectively, as well as
          individually. In addition to basic groups, it is also possible
          for any VM to be in more than one group, and for groups to be
          nested in a hierarchy. This means you can have groups of
          groups. In general, the operations that can be performed on
          groups are the same as those that can be applied to individual
          VMs: Start, Pause, Reset, Close (Save state, Send Shutdown,

          design with well-defined internal programming interfaces and a
          clean separation of client and server code. This makes it easy
          to control it from several interfaces at once. For example,
          you can start a VM simply by clicking on a button in the
          &product-name; graphical user interface and then control that
          machine from the command line, or even remotely. See
          <xref linkend="frontends" />.
        </para>

        <para>
          Due to its modular architecture, &product-name; can also
          expose its full functionality and configurability through a
          comprehensive <emphasis role="bold">software development kit

          <emphasis role="bold">Remote machine display.</emphasis> The
          VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension (VRDE) enables
          high-performance remote access to any running virtual machine.
          This extension supports the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
          originally built into Microsoft Windows, with special
          additions for full client USB support.
        </para>

        <para>
          The VRDE does not rely on the RDP server that is built into
          Microsoft Windows. Instead, the VRDE is plugged directly into
          the virtualization layer. As a result, it works with guest
          OSes other than Windows, even in text mode, and does not
          require application support in the virtual machine either. The
          VRDE is described in detail in <xref linkend="vrde" />.

          <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">Base Memory.</emphasis> Select the
            amount of RAM that &product-name; should allocate every time
            the virtual machine is started. The amount of memory
            selected here will be taken away from your host machine and
            presented to the guest OS, which will report this size as
            the virtual machines installed RAM.
          </para>

          <caution>
            <para>
              Choose this setting carefully. The memory you give to the
              VM will not be available to your host OS while the VM is
              running, so do not specify more than you can spare.
            </para>

            <para>
              For example, if your host machine has 4 GB of RAM and you
              enter 2048 MB as the amount of RAM for a particular
              virtual machine, you will only have 2 GB left for all the
              other software on your host while the VM is running. If
              you run two VMs at the same time, even more memory will be
              allocated for the second VM, which may not even be able to
              start if that memory is not available.
            </para>

            <para>
              On the other hand, you should specify as much as your
              guest OS and your applications will require to run
              properly. A guest OS may require at least 1 or 2 GB of
              memory to install and boot up. For best performance, more
              memory than that may be required.
            </para>
          </caution>

          <para>
            Always ensure that the host OS has enough RAM remaining. If
            insufficient RAM remains, the system might excessively swap
            memory to the hard disk, which effectively brings the host
            system to a standstill.

        Otherwise, if the virtual machine detects only standard PS/2
        mouse and keyboard devices, since the OS in the virtual machine
        does not know that it is not running on a real computer, it
        expects to have exclusive control over your keyboard and mouse.
        But unless you are running the VM in full screen mode, your VM
        needs to share keyboard and mouse with other applications and
        possibly other VMs on your host.

        After installing a guest OS and before you install the Guest

            Your <emphasis role="bold">keyboard</emphasis> is owned by
            the VM if the VM window on your host desktop has the
            keyboard focus. If you have many windows open in your guest
            OS, the window that has the focus in your VM is used. This
            means that if you want to enter text within your VM, click
            on the title bar of your VM window first.
          </para>

          <para>
            To release keyboard ownership, press the Host key. As
            explained above, this is typically the right Ctrl key.
          </para>

          <para>
            Note that while the VM owns the keyboard, some key
            sequences, such as Alt+Tab, will no longer be seen by the
            host, but will go to the guest instead. After you press the
            Host key to reenable the host keyboard, all key presses will
            go through the host again, so that sequences such as Alt+Tab
            will no longer reach the guest. For technical reasons it may
            not be possible for the VM to get all keyboard input even
            when it does own the keyboard. Examples of this are the
            Ctrl+Alt+Del sequence on Windows hosts or single keys
            grabbed by other applications on X11 hosts such as the GNOME

          </para>

          <para>
            Note that mouse ownership is independent of that of the

      <title>Typing Special Characters</title>

      <para>
        Some OSes expect certain key combinations to initiate certain
        procedures. The key combinations that you type into a VM might
        target the host OS, the &product-name; software, or the guest
        OS. The recipient of these keypresses depends on a number of
        factors, including the key combination itself.

            Host OSes reserve certain key combinations for themselves.

            <emphasis role="bold">Ctrl+Alt+Delete</emphasis> combination
            to reboot the guest OS in your VM, because this key
            combination is reserved by the host OS. Even though both
            Windows and Linux OSes can intercept this key combination,
            the host OS is rebooted automatically.
          </para>

          <para>
            On Linux and Oracle Solaris hosts, which use the X Window

            resets the X server and restarts the entire graphical user
            interface. As the X server intercepts this combination,
            pressing it will usually restart your
            <emphasis>host</emphasis> graphical user interface and kill
            all running programs, including &product-name;, in the
            process.

            where Fx is one of the function keys from F1 to F12,
            normally enables you to switch between virtual terminals. As
            with <emphasis role="bold">Ctrl+Alt+Delete</emphasis>, these

        The difference between the three options is crucial. They mean

          <para>
            When you start the VM again later, you will find that the VM
            continues exactly where it was left off. All your programs
            will still be open, and your computer resumes operation.
            Saving the state of a virtual machine is thus in some ways
            similar to suspending a laptop computer by closing its lid.
          </para>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">Send the shutdown signal.</emphasis>
            This will send an ACPI shutdown signal to the virtual
            machine, which has the same effect as if you had pressed the
            power button on a real computer. This should trigger a
            proper shutdown mechanism from within the VM.

          <warning>
            <para>
              This is equivalent to pulling the power plug on a real

              the machine again after powering it off, your OS will have
              to reboot completely and may begin a lengthy check of its
              virtual system disks. As a result, this should not
              normally be done, since it can potentially cause data loss
              or an inconsistent state of the guest system on disk.
            </para>

          <para>
            As an exception, if your virtual machine has any snapshots,
            see <xref linkend="snapshots"/>, you can use this option to
            quickly <emphasis role="bold">restore the current
            snapshot</emphasis> of the virtual machine. In that case,
            powering off the machine will discard the current state and
            any changes made since the previous snapshot was taken will
            be lost.

        The <emphasis role="bold">Discard</emphasis> button in the

      state, even though you may have changed the VM considerably since
      then. A snapshot of a virtual machine is thus similar to a machine

              Restoring a snapshot will affect the virtual hard drives

              Whereas taking and restoring snapshots are fairly quick

              amount of time since large amounts of data may need to be
              copied between several disk image files. Temporary disk
              files may also need large amounts of disk space while the

            There are some situations which cannot be handled while a VM
            is running, and you will get an appropriate message that you

      <title>Snapshot Contents</title>

      <para>
        Think of a snapshot as a point in time that you have preserved.
        More formally, a snapshot consists of the following:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            The snapshot contains a complete copy of the VM settings,
            including the hardware configuration, so that when you
            restore a snapshot, the VM settings are restored as well.
            For example, if you changed the hard disk configuration or
            the VM's system settings, that change is undone when you
            restore the snapshot.
          </para>

          <para>
            The copy of the settings is stored in the machine
            configuration, an XML text file, and thus occupies very
            little space.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            The complete state of all the virtual disks attached to the
            machine is preserved. Going back to a snapshot means that
            all changes that had been made to the machine's disks, file
            by file and bit by bit, will be undone as well. Files that
            were since created will disappear, files that were deleted
            will be restored, changes to files will be reverted.
          </para>

          <para>
            Strictly speaking, this is only true for virtual hard disks
            in "normal" mode. You can configure disks to behave
            differently with snapshots, see
            <xref linkend="hdimagewrites" />. In technical terms, it is
            not the virtual disk itself that is restored when a snapshot
            is restored. Instead, when a snapshot is taken,
            &product-name; creates differencing images which contain
            only the changes since the snapshot were taken. When the
            snapshot is restored, &product-name; throws away that
            differencing image, thus going back to the previous state.
            This is both faster and uses less disk space. For the
            details, which can be complex, see
            <xref linkend="diffimages" />.
          </para>

          <para>
            Creating the differencing image as such does not occupy much
            space on the host disk initially, since the differencing
            image will initially be empty and grow dynamically later
            with each write operation to the disk. The longer you use
            the machine after having created the snapshot, however, the
            more the differencing image will grow in size.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            If you took a snapshot while the machine was running, the
            memory state of the machine is also saved in the snapshot.
            This is in the same way that memory can be saved when you
            close a VM window. When you restore such a snapshot,
            execution resumes at exactly the point when the snapshot was
            taken.
          </para>

          <para>
            The memory state file can be as large as the memory size of
            the VM and will therefore occupy considerable disk space.

    <title>Alternative Front-Ends</title>

    <para>
      As briefly mentioned in <xref linkend="features-overview" />,
      &product-name; has a very flexible internal design that enables
      you to use multiple interfaces to control the same virtual
      machines. For example, you can start a virtual machine with the
      &vbox-mgr; window and then stop it from the command line. With
      &product-name;'s support for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),
      you can even run virtual machines remotely on a headless server
      and have all the graphical output redirected over the network.
    </para>

          toolkit. This interface is described throughout this manual.
          While this is the simplest and easiest front-end to use, some
          of the more advanced &product-name; features are not included.

          <emphasis role="bold">VBoxHeadless.</emphasis> A front-end

          act as a RDP server if the VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension
          (VRDE) is installed and enabled for the VM. As opposed to the
          other graphical interfaces, the headless front-end requires no
          graphics support. This is useful, for example, if you want to
          host your virtual machines on a headless Linux server that has
          no X Window system installed. See
