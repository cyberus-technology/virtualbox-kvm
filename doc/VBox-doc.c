 *
 * @section Execution Contexts
 *
 * VirtualBox defines a number of different execution context, this can be
 * confusing at first.  So, to start with take a look at this diagram:
 *
 * @image html VMMContexts.png
 *
 * Context definitions:
 *      - Host context (HC) - This is the context where the host OS runs and
 *        runs VirtualBox within it.  The absense of IN_RC and IN_GUEST
 *        indicates that we're in HC.  IN_RING0 indicates ring-0 (kernel) and
 *        IN_RING3 indicates ring-3.
 *      - Raw-mode Context (RC) - This is the special VMM context where we
 *        execute the guest code directly on the CPU.  Kernel code is patched
 *        and execute in ring-1 instead of ring-0 (ring compression).  Ring-3
 *        code execute unmodified.  Only VMMs use ring-1, so we don't need to
 *        worry about that (it's guarded against in the scheduler (EM)).  We can
 *        in theory run ring-2 there, but since practially only only OS/2 uses
 *        ring-2, it is of little importance.  The macro IN_RC indicates that
 *        we're compiling something for RC.
 *        Note! This used to be called GC (see below) earlier, so a bunch of RC
 *        things are using GC markers.
 *      - Guest Context (GC) - This is where the guest code is executed.  When
 *        compiling, IN_GUEST indicates that it's for GC.  IN_RING0 and
 *        IN_RING3 are also set when applicable, these are accompanied by
 *        IN_GUEST_R0 and IN_GUEST_R3 respecitively.
 *      - Intermediate context - This is a special memory context used within
 *        the world switchers (HC -> RC and back), it features some identity
 *        mapped code pages so we can switch to real mode if necessary.
